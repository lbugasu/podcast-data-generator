However, despite raising millions of dollars for Ethiopia, the song has come to be seen by many as perpetuating negative stereotypes of Africa. Culture writer Nels Abbey and music journalist Maura Johnston reflect on the song\u2019s legacy\u2014as well as a whole new controversy surrounding the new 40th-anniversary version of the song.
