Deadly viruses. These problems are so hard to tackle because the goalposts are always moving. Thanks to evolution, these diseases often outpace therapies and vaccines.  </p>\n<p>Today, NFX General Partner and Head of NFX Bio Omri Amirav-Drory is sitting down with two Founders using platforms to stay a step ahead of evolution. Jacob Glanville, Founder of Centivax, has developed a platform to create broad spectrum vaccines capable of arming the immune system against rapidly mutating viruses (like COVID-19 or influenza). Nick Goldner, Founder of resistanceBio, discusses his approach for mapping all the possible resistance paths a cancer can take in the human body \u2013 and developing therapies to shut those escape routes down.  </p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why we need platforms to tackle biology\u2019s biggest problems, what it takes to build a platform company, and their advice for fundraising in Techbio.</p>\n\n\n(0:00) Introduction to the episode and guests\n(1:45) Founders' journeys: Nick Goldner and Jacob Glanville\n(8:19) Discussion on platform technologies in biotech\n(23:30) In-depth look at Resistance Bio and Sentivax's platforms and business models\n(28:45) Strategies for addressing infectious diseases\n(34:15) Overcoming challenges in scientific entrepreneurship\n(34:59) Transition to discussing fundraising experiences\n(43:42) Understanding the investor's perspective and adapting based on feedback\n(47:34) Vision for the future of their platforms and the intersection of biology and technology\n(51:33) Outro and podcast reminders\n",

They also touch on balancing personal life with startup demands and the role of female leadership in tech.\n\n<p>The Covid pandemic removed barriers to global hiring and remote team building. It exposed startups, by necessity, to all-new solutions for growing and bonding their teams. Most companies advanced through the pandemic by stages: first survival mode, then waiting it out -- and now they are ready to fundamentally shift their hiring strategies to reflect our new reality. It\u2019s clear now that there are lasting shifts in the market, and that Founders and CEOs need to update their mental models for hiring. Our guest today, Eynat Guez, sees this recent change in strategy more clearly than most. She\u2019s the Co-Founder and CEO of Papaya Global, a global people &amp; payroll platform, now valued at $3.7 Billion. Eynat is also the first-ever female CEO of a unicorn company in Israel. Her insights on hiring are twofold. First, she builds from her own experience rapidly scaling her global team to unicorn status during the pandemic. Second, from working directly with Papaya\u2019s clients to grow their teams. Today she shares with us her set of mental models for building a world-class team -- wherever it may be.</p>\n\n\n(0:00) Introduction to the podcast and guest, Eynat Guez\n(4:36) The impact of remote work on global hiring and company culture\n(15:02) The role of founder's personality in shaping company's DNA and recruitment strategies\n(27:18) Overcoming challenges in automating processes and the importance of customer experience\n(38:51) The significance of planning ahead in early-stage startups and the potential impact of crypto on payroll\n(47:06) Transition from early founder to unicorn CEO and managing growth in startups\n(54:06) Balancing personal life with the demands of a startup and the importance of female leadership in the tech ecosystem\n(57:26) Closing remarks and future prospects for Eynat Guez's next startup\n",

The conversation also covers growth tactics after achieving product-market fit, the costs of losing focus, and understanding competitor strategies.\n\n<p>Underlying Waze&#39;s journey is a little-known approach to product thinking, super-powerful data network effects, and a guiding north star metric.

I have decided to publish this in the event it is helpful to entrepreneurs building their cultures.&quot; In this famous memo from the early days of Aribnb, CEO Brian Chesky stresses the importance of having a succinct company outlook on culture.  </p>\n<p>&quot;Why is culture so important to a business? Here is a simple way to frame it. The stronger the culture, the less corporate process a company needs. When the culture is strong, you can trust everyone to do the right thing. People can be independent and autonomous.&quot;  </p>\n<p>Read the full letter here - <a href=\"https://medium.com/@bchesky/dont-fuck-up-the-culture-597cde9ee9d4\">https://medium.com/@bchesky/dont-fuck-up-the-culture-597cde9ee9d4</a></p>\n",

In this NFX conversation with James Currier, they talk about the opportunities of AR, VR and the future of human connection.\u00a0  </p>\n<p>Highlights from the conversation:  </p>\n<p>- Allow yourself to become obsessed with something. Really obsess about the product and dream about what it can become.<br>- Invest in things that will become part of your life.\u00a0<br>- Futurism is more than being intellectual, it\u2019s more about daydreaming, it\u2019s about how you feel and how you live.<br>- Silicon Valley is getting too serious. Where did the hacker mentality go? AR, and crypto are real frontier categories where there is still bright eyedness of \u201cwe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d<br>- Endless curiosity helps identify people who are solving problems that are actually real problems.<br>- Be curious about how systems work. Analyze businesses and what makes them special. Try to figure out the economics of everything, anything.<br>- Sometimes it makes sense to paint inside the lines, but sometimes you really have to paint outside the lines.  </p>\n<p>Regarding the future of VR: There&#39;s no reason why you and I, if we want to hang out, that we have maybe 8 options\u2026 go to dinner, have a phone call, see a movie, maybe go for a walk\u2026 but why aren&#39;t there thousands of options?
