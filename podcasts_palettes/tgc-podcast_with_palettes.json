Social media is a huge beast, and we need more than \u201cset a timer\u201d (as helpful as that can be) to help us navigate the world of social media in a gospel-centered way.</p><p>Pulling in part from TGC's book, <a href=\"https://store.thegospelcoalition.org/tgc/products/12637/social-sanity-in-an-insta\"><i>Social Sanity in an Insta World</i></a>, panelists Amy Gannett, Blair Linne, and Laura Wifler explore ways of using social media to the glory of God. They cover a wide range of ideas, from the big picture (figure out why you're logging on) to the daily details (to re-ground yourself after scrolling, try concentrating on your five senses), all while offering encouragement to those who might be burned out by social media.</p>\n",
