You heard hints of this in some of the stories we told in Resettled: One of the first things that resettlement agencies in the U.S. recommend is taking English classes. \nWe want to share a story about language from another podcast we think you\u2019ll like, called Neighbors. The show is a deep dive into the stories of ordinary people that reflect our common humanity. \nThis particular episode, \"The Language Learner,\" follows the story of a man who resettled with his family in Nashville, Tennessee after being forced from his home country of Myanmar\u2014formerly known as Burma.\nThis story was produced by Jakob Lewis in conjunction with Nashville Public Radio.\u00a0 Production assistance from Bailey Robbins. Edited by Emily Siner and Mack Linebaugh. Music by Podington Bear. To hear more stories from Neighbors, search in your favorite podcast app or go to www.neighborspodcast.com.",

In her senior year at Harrisonburg High School, Fatimah decided to try out for the school play, which pushed her boundaries around sexuality and acceptance. Harrisonburg, Virginia is unique as well: there more than 50 languages and countries represented in Harrisonburg\u2019s public schools. Not every refugee teen experience is a positive one, but the overwhelming support and pride that the Harrisonburg community takes in its immigrants and refugees means that leaders prioritize their needs in a way that the federal government often doesn't.",
