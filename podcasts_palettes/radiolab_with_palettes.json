Or does i just need a ... tweak?\n\nBack in 2018, when this episode first aired, there was a feeling that democracy was on the ropes.  In the United States and abroad, citizens of democracies are feeling increasingly alienated, disaffected, and powerless.  Some are even asking themselves a question that feels almost too dangerous to say out loud: is democracy fundamentally broken?  \n\nToday on Radiolab, we ask a different question: how do we fix it?  We scrutinize one proposed tweak to the way we vote that could make politics in this country more representative, more moderate, and most shocking of all, more civil.  Could this one surprisingly do-able mathematical fix really turn political campaigning from a rude bloodsport to a campfire singalong? And even if we could do that, would we want to?\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Rob Richie (and everyone else at Fairvote), Don Saari, Diana Leygerman, Caroline Tolbert, Bobby Agee, Edward Still, Jim Blacksher, Allen Caton, Nikolas Bowie, John Hale, and Anna Luhrmann and the rest of the team at the Varieties of Democracy Institute in Sweden.\n\nAnd a very special thanks to Rick Pickren, for allowing us to use his rendition of State of Maine, Maine\u2019s state anthem. Check that out, and all his other state anthems on Spotify or Youtube.\n\nEPISODE CREDITS: \nReported by L-atif Nasser, Simon Adler, Sarah Qari, Suzie Lechtenberg and Tracie Hunte\nProduced by - Simon Adler, Matt Kielty, Sarah Qari, and Suzie Lechtenberg\nOriginal music and sound design contributed by - Simon Adler\n\nOur newsletter comes out every Wednesday.

Cardiac arrests can happen anywhere, anytime - in your bed, on the street, on your honeymoon. And every minute that passes after your heart stops beating, your chances of surviving drop dramatically. For all the strides modern medicine has made in treating heart conditions, the ambulance still doesn\u2019t always make it in time.

In this quiet suburban spot, two groups of ants are putting on a chilling display of dismemberment and death. According to David, this battle line marks the edge of an enormous super-colony of Argentine ants. Think of that anthill in your backyard, and stretch it out across five continents.</p><p>Argentine ants are not good neighbors. When they meet ants from another colony, any other colony, they fight to the death, and tear the other ants to pieces. While other kinds of ants sometimes take slaves or even have sex with ants from different colonies, the Argentine ants don\u2019t fool around. If you\u2019re not part of the colony, you\u2019re dead.</p><p>According to evolutionary biologist Neil Tsutsui and ecologist Mark Moffett, the flood plains of northern Argentina offer a clue as to how these ants came to dominate the planet. Because of the frequent flooding, the homeland of Linepithema humile is basically a bootcamp for badass ants. One day, a couple ants from one of these families of Argentine ants made their way onto a boat and landed in New Orleans in the late 1800s. Over the last century, these Argentine ants wreaked havoc across the southern U.S. and a significant chunk of coastal California.</p><p>In fact, Melissa Thomas, an Australian entomologist, reveals that these Argentine ants are even more well-heeled than we expected - they've made to every continent except Antarctica. No matter how many thousands of miles separate individual ants, when researchers place two of them together - whether they're plucked from Australia, Japan, Hawaii ... even Easter Island - they recognize each other as belonging to the same super-colony.</p><p>But the really mind-blowing thing about these little guys is the surprising success of their us-versus-them death-dealing. Jad and Robert wrestle with what to make of this ant regime, whether it will last, and what, if anything, it might mean for other warlike organisms with global ambitions.<br /><br />We have some exciting news!

This rant, in particular, comes from Dan Engber - a science writer who loves animals but despises animal intelligence research. Dan told us that so much of the way we study animals involves tests that we think show a human is smart ... not the animals we intend to study. \n\nDan\u2019s rant got us thinking: What is the smartest animal in the world? And if we threw out our human intelligence rubric, is there a fair way to figure it out?\n\nObviously, there is. And it\u2019s a live game show, judged by Jad, Robert \u2026 and a dog.\n\nThe last episode of G, our series on intelligence, was recorded as a live show back in May 2019 at the Greene Space in New York City and now we\u2019re sharing that game show with you, again. Two science writers, Dan Engber and Laurel Braitman, and two comedians, Tracy Clayton and Jordan Mendoza, compete against one another to find the world\u2019s smartest animal.

                    "itunes:summary": "As co-host Latif Nasser was putting his kid to bed one night, he noticed something weird on a solar system poster up on the wall: Venus had a moon called \u2026 Zoozve.\u00a0 But when he called NASA to ask them about it, they had never heard of Zoozve, and besides that, they insisted that Venus doesn\u2019t have any moons.\u00a0 So begins a tiny mystery that leads to a newly discovered kind of object in our solar system, one that is simultaneously a moon, but also not a moon, and one that waltzes its way into asking one of the most profound questions about our universe:\u00a0 How predictable is it, really? And what does that mean for our place in it? Special Thanks to Larry Wasserman and everyone else at the Lowell Observatory, Rich Kremer and Marcelo Gleiser of Dartmouth College, Benjamin Sharkey at the University of Maryland. Thanks to the IAU and their Working Group for Small Bodies Nomenclature, as well as to the Bamboo Forest class of kindergarteners and first graders. \n\nWe have some exciting news! In this \u201cZoozve\u201d episode, Radiolab named its first-ever quasi-moon, and now it's your turn!

But when he started to work in the ICU, he slowly realized that sometimes keeping people (and their hopes) alive just prolongs the suffering. He wrote a book arguing that a too-late death is just as bad as a too-early one, and that physicians and the public alike need to get better at accepting the inevitability of death sooner.\u00a0 As the book hit the bestseller list, Blair\u2019s own father got diagnosed with a deadly case of pancreatic cancer. Blair\u2019s every impulse was in direct contradiction of the book he just wrote. What should he do?

The first Mexican-American to ever hold the position, Reyes knows something needs to change and has an idea how to do it. One Saturday night at midnight, with the element of surprise on his side, Reyes unveils ... Operation Blockade. It wins widespread support for the Border Patrol in El Paso, but sparks major protests across the Rio Grande.

We look at what sound does to our bodies, our brains, our feelings\u2026 and we go back to the reason we at Radiolab tell you stories the way we do.\u00a0\nFirst, we look at Diana Deutsch\u2019s work on language and music, and how certain languages seem to promote musicality in humans. Then we meet Psychologist Anne Fernald and listen to parents as they talk to their babies across languages and cultures. Last, we go to 1913 Paris and sneak into the premiere of Igor Stravinsky\u2019s score of The Rite of Spring.\u00a0\nCheck out Diana Deutsch's 'Audio Illusions' here (https://deutsch.ucsd.edu/psychology/pages.php?i=201).\u00a0\nOur newsletter comes out every Wednesday.

This week, we talk to Julia about her journey to the host seat, and we highlight an episode she produced for Radiolab in 2019 about a specific case: Gonz\u00e1lez v. Williams.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In 1903 the U.S. Supreme Court refused to say that Isabel Gonz\u00e1lez was a citizen of the United States. Then again, they said, she wasn\u2019t exactly an immigrant either. And they said that the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, Isabel\u2019s home, was \u201cforeign to the United States in a domestic sense.\u201d Since then, the U.S. has cleared up at least some of the confusion about U.S. territories and the status of people born in them.</p>\n<p>But, more than a hundred years later, there is still a U.S. territory that has been left in limbo: American Samoa. It is the only place on Earth that is U.S. soil, but people who are born there are not automatically U.S. citizens. When we visit American Samoa, we discover that there are some pretty surprising reasons why many American Samoans prefer it that way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>EPISODE CREDITS\u00a0</p>\n<p>Reported by - Julia Longoria</p>\n<p><em>Our newsletter comes out every Wednesday.

But should he?</p>\n<p>In 2004, when casualties in Iraq were rising due to roadside bombs, Ross McNutt and his team came up with an idea. With a small plane and a 44 megapixel camera, they figured out how to watch an entire city all at once, all day long. Whenever a bomb detonated, they could zoom into that spot and then, because this eye in the sky had been there all along, they could scroll back in time and see\u2014literally see\u2014who planted it.

And how some games can make you feel, at least for a little while, like your whole life hangs in the balance. This hour of Radiolab, Jad and Robert wonder why we get so invested in something so trivial. What is it about games that make them feel so pivotal?</p>\n<p>We hear how a recurring dream about football turned into a real-life lesson for Stephen Dubner, we watch a chessboard turn into a playground where by-the-book moves give way to totally unpredictable possibilities, and we talk to Dan Engber, a one time senior editor at Slate, now at The Atlantic, and a bunch of scientists about why betting on a longshot is so much fun.

To prepare himself and his colleagues for the patients they might see, and to think through how best to treat them, Avir asked Laura MacIsaac, one of New York City\u2019s leading gynecologists and abortion experts, to come talk to his ER department. But what Dr. MacIsaac had to say in her lecture wasn\u2019t what Avir expected: she didn\u2019t talk about how we\u2019re going back in time and the horrors of self-harm as a means to an abortion. Instead, she painted a picture of progress \u2014 how in the last 40 years, through private practice and clinical trials all around the world, the process and science of providing and having an abortion has changed dramatically, mostly because of two types of pills: misoprostol and mifepristone.

To prepare himself and his colleagues for the patients they might see, and to think through how best to treat them, Avir asked Laura MacIsaac, one of New York City\u2019s leading gynecologists and abortion experts, to come talk to his ER department.

Instead, she painted a picture of progress \u2014 how in the last 40 years, through private practice and clinical trials all around the world, the process and science of providing and having an abortion has changed dramatically, mostly because of two types of pills: misoprostol and mifepristone.

But these days, quicksand can't even scare an 8-year-old. In this short, we try to find out why.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then-Producer Soren Wheeler introduces us to Dan Engber, writer and columnist for <em>Slate</em>, now with <em>The Atlantic</em>. Dan became obsessed with quicksand after happening upon a strange fact: kids are no longer afraid of it. In this episode, Dan recounts for Soren and Robert Krulwich the story of his obsession. He immersed himself in research, compiled mountains of data, met with quicksand fetishists and, in the end, formulated a theory about why the terror of his childhood seems to have lost its menacing allure. Then Carlton Cuse, who at the time we first aired this episode was best-known as the writer and executive producer of <em>Lost</em>, helps us think about whether giant pits of hero-swallowing mud might one day creep back into the spotlight.And, as this episode first aired in 2013, we can see if we were right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Episode Credits:Reported and produced by Soren Wheeler</p>\n<p><em>Our newsletter comes out every Wednesday.

He's a queer, Black, first-generation college student from Kansas City, Missouri who joined the debate team at Emporia State University on a whim. When he started going up against fast-talking, well-funded, \u201cname-brand\u201d teams, from places like Northwestern and Harvard, it was clear he wasn\u2019t in Kansas anymore. So Ryan became the vanguard of a movement that made everything about debate debatable. In the end, he made himself a home in a strange and hostile land.

And those sudden superpowers can be a boon when you\u2019re running from a lion. But repeatedly dipping into that well can make you sick, even kill you.
