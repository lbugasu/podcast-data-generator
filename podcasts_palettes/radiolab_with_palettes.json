In the process, we see if we can find a satisfying answer to the question \u201cwhy do we have to die\u201d and find ourselves face to face with the bitter end of everything that ever existed.<br /><br /><i>Special thanks to Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, Steven Nadler, Beth Jarosz, Anjana Badrinarayanan, Shaon Chakrabarti, Bob Horvitz, John K.

Usually, Bob sticks to playing piano for small groups of ragtime enthusiasts, but he recently caught the attention of Penn State neuroscientist Kerstin Bettermann, who had heard that Bob had a rare talent: He can play technically challenging pieces of music on demand while carrying on a conversation and cracking jokes. According to Kerstin, our brains just aren't wired for that. So she decided to investigate Bob's brain, and along the way she discovered that Bob has an even more amazing ability\u2014one that we could hardly believe and science can't explain.\nOur newsletter comes out every Wednesday.

            "content": "<p>While scouring the Sonoran Desert for objects left behind by migrants crossing into the United States, anthropologist Jason De Le\u00f3n happened upon something he didn't expect to get left behind: a human arm, stripped of flesh.</p>\n<p>This macabre discovery sent him reeling, needing to know what exactly happened to the body, and how many migrants die that way in the wilderness. In researching border-crosser deaths in the Arizona desert, he noticed something surprising. Sometime in the late-1990s, the number of migrant deaths shot up dramatically and have stayed high since. Jason traced this increase to a Border Patrol policy still in effect, called \u201cPrevention Through Deterrence.\u201d</p>\n<p>First aired in 2018 and over three episodes, Radiolab investigates this policy, its surprising origins, and the people whose lives were changed forever because of it.</p>\n<p>Part 3: What Remains\u00a0</p>\n<p>The third episode in our Border Trilogy follows anthropologist Jason De Le\u00f3n after he makes a grisly discovery in Arivaca, Arizona.

The first Mexican-American to ever hold the position, Reyes knows something needs to change and has an idea how to do it. One Saturday night at midnight, with the element of surprise on his side, Reyes unveils ... Operation Blockade. It wins widespread support for the Border Patrol in El Paso, but sparks major protests across the Rio Grande. Soon after, he gets a phone call that catapults his little experiment onto the national stage, where it works so well that it diverts migrant crossing patterns along the entire U.S.-Mexico Border.</p>\n<p>Years later, in the Arizona desert, anthropologist Jason de Le\u00f3n realizes that in order to accurately gauge how many migrants die crossing the desert, he must first understand how human bodies decompose in such an extreme environment. He sets up a macabre experiment, and what he finds is more drastic than anything he could have expected.</p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Sherrie Kossoudji at the University of Michigan, Lynn M.

His excuse: Border Patrol. Soon more stories of students getting stopped and harassed by Border Patrol started pouring in. So begins the unlikely story of how a handful of Mexican-American high schoolers in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country stood up to what is today the country\u2019s largest federal law enforcement agency. They had no way of knowing at the time, but what would follow was a chain of events that would drastically change the US-Mexico border.</p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Centro de Salud Familiar La Fe, Estela Reyes L\u00f3pez, Barbara Hines, Lynn M.

                "summary": "Sad news for all of us: producer Rachael Cusick\u2014 who brought us soul-stirring stories rethinking grief (https://zpr.io/GZ6xEvpzsbHU) and solitude (https://zpr.io/eT5tAX6JtYra), as well as colorful musings on airplane farts (https://zpr.io/CNpgUijZiuZ4) and belly flops (https://zpr.io/uZrEz27z63CB) and Blueberry Earths (https://zpr.io/EzxgtdTRGVzz)\u2014 is leaving the show. So we thought it perfect timing to sit down with her and revisit another brainchild of hers, The Cataclysm Sentence, a collection of advice for The End.\nTo explain: one day in 1961, the famous physicist Richard Feynman stepped in front of a Caltech lecture hall and posed this question to a group of undergraduate students: \u201cIf, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence was passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words?\u201d Now, Feynman had an answer to his own question\u2014a good one. But his question got the entire team at Radiolab wondering, what did his sentence leave out? So we posed Feynman\u2019s cataclysm question to some of our favorite writers, artists, historians, futurists\u2014all kinds of great thinkers. We asked them \u201cWhat\u2019s the one sentence you would want to pass on to the next generation that would contain the most information in the fewest words?\u201d What came back was an explosive collage of what it means to be alive right here and now, and what we want to say before we go.\nFeaturing:\nRichard Feynman, physicist - The Pleasure of Finding Things Out (https://zpr.io/5KngTGibPVDw)\nCaitlin Doughty, mortician - Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs (https://zpr.io/Wn4bQgHzDRDB)\nEsperanza Spalding, musician - 12 Little Spells (https://zpr.io/KMjYrkwrz9dy)\u00a0\nCord Jefferson, writer - Watchmen (https://zpr.io/ruqKDQGy5Rv8)\u00a0\nMerrill Garbus, musician - I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life (https://zpr.io/HmrqFX8RKuFq)\nJenny Odell, writer - How to do Nothing (https://zpr.io/JrUHu8dviFqc)\nMaria Popova, writer - Brainpickings (https://zpr.io/vsHXphrqbHiN)\nAlison Gopnik, developmental psychologist - The Gardener and the Carpenter (https://zpr.io/ewtJpUYxpYqh)\nRebecca Sugar, animator - Steven Universe (https://zpr.io/KTtSrdsBtXB7)\nNicholson Baker, writer - Substitute (https://zpr.io/QAh2d7J9QJf2)\nJames Gleick, writer - Time Travel (https://zpr.io/9CWX9q3KmZj8)\nLady Pink, artist - too many amazing works to pick just one (https://zpr.io/FkJh6edDBgRL)\nJenny Hollwell, writer - Everything Lovely, Effortless, Safe (https://zpr.io/MjP5UJb3mMYP)\nJaron Lanier, futurist - Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now (https://zpr.io/bxWiHLhPyuEK)\nMissy Mazzoli, composer - Proving Up (https://zpr.io/hTwGcHGk93Ty)\n\u00a0\nSpecial Thanks to:\nElla Frances Sanders, and her book, \"Eating the Sun\" (https://zpr.io/KSX6DruwRaYL), for inspiring this whole episode.\nCaltech for letting us use original audio of The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

Actually, those two things happened on the exact same day, at the exact same hour. In the shadow of that nightmarish timing, Cat found her way to a sport that celebrated the solitude that was forced on her, and taught her how to not only embrace self-reliance, but to love it.\u00a0\nThis sport is called competitive bikepacking. And in these competitions, riders have to bring everything they need to complete epic bike rides totally by themselves. They pack all the supplies they think they\u2019ll need to survive, and have to refuse some of the simplest, subtlest, most intangible boosts that exist in our world.\nBut a leader has emerged in this sport. Her name is Lael Wilcox, and she\u2019s a total rockstar in the world of competitive bikepacking. She\u2019s broken all kinds of records. And also, some rules. Most recently, on this one ride she did across the entire state of Arizona.\nWe set out to find out what it means \u2014 for Cat, for Lael, and for any of us \u2014 to endure incredibly hard things, totally alone. The answer is on the course, in our bodies, and hidden in that mysterious place between us and the people we care about.\nSpecial thanks to Anna Haslock, Nico Sandi, Michael Fryar, Moab Public Radio, Nichole Baker and Payson McElveen for sharing their studio with us, and The Radavist, for letting us use the audio of Lael\u2019s ride across Arizona.

As Charles's friend Richard Ure and writer Arika Okrent (https://zpr.io/3gjsdSePpQbG) explain, Bliss believed that war was often caused by the misuse of language. Having lived through the hell of Nazi concentration camps, he set about creating the perfect language, based on symbols and logic. Years later, Shirley McNaughton accidentally discovered it, and started using it to communicate with her students -- kids with cerebral palsy who quickly picked up the language and made it their own. At first, Charles was thrilled...until he started to feel his original dream of saving the world was slipping from his fingers.And finally, co-host Latif Nasser (https://zpr.io/pJsnQSYWJLTe) explains how, on a cold, snowy farm in Vermont in 1880, a kid named Wilson Bentley put a snowflake under a microscope and started a lifelong quest to capture perfection.\nEPISODE CREDITS:Reported by - Tim HowardProduced by - Tim Howard\nCITATIONS:\nVideos:\nAleksander and his glorious gift to his future self.

Why does he keep running... and will he ever stop? Next, the ingeniously simple question that led Isaac Newton to an enormous intellectual breakthrough: why doesn\u2019t the moon fall out of the sky? In the wake of Newton's new idea, we find ourselves in a strange space at the edge of the solar system, about to cross a boundary beyond which we know nothing.

            "contentSnippet": "Fantasy writer Elsa Sjunneson has been haunted by Helen Keller for nearly her entire life. Like Helen, Elsa is Deafblind, and growing up she was constantly compared to her. But for a million different reasons she hated that, because she felt different from her in a million different ways. Then, a year ago, an online conspiracy theory claiming Helen was a fraud exploded on TikTok, and suddenly Elsa found herself drawing her sword and jumping to Helen\u2019s defense, setting off a chain of events that would bring her closer to the disability icon than she ever dreamt. For over a year, Elsa, Lulu and the Radiolab team dug through primary sources, talked to experts, even visited Helen\u2019s birthplace Ivy Green, and discovered the real story of Helen Keller is far more complicated, mysterious and confounding than the simple myth of a young Deafblind girl rescued by her teacher Annie Sullivan. It\u2019s a story of ghosts, surprises, a few tears, a bit of romance, some hard conversations, and a possibly psychic dog.This episode was reported by Elsa Sjunneson and Lulu Miller.

It\u2019s the chaos of life.\nLatif, Lulu, and our Senior Producer Matt Kielty were all sitting on their own little stories until they got thrown into the studio, and had their cherished beliefs about the shape of life put on a collision course. From an accidental study of sea creatures, to the ambitions of Stephen J Gould, to an undercooked theory that captured the world\u2019s imagination, we undo the seeming order of the living world and try to make some music out of the wreckage. (Bonus: Learn how Francis Crick really thought life got started on this planet).\nThis episode was reported by Latif Nasser, Matt Kielty, Heather Radke, Lulu Miller and Candice Wang. It was produced by Matt Kielty and Simon Adler. Sound and music from Matt Kielty, Simon Adler, and Jeremy Bloom, and dialogue mix by Arianne Wack.Special thanks to Alan and Alida Goffinski\u00a0for giving our chaos musical life in the song at the end of the episode.\nRadiolab is on YouTube!

Using evidence painstakingly gathered around the world - from Mongolian tree rings to Greenlandic ice cores to Mayan artifacts - we paint a portrait of what scientists and historians think went wrong, and what we think it felt like to be there in real time.
