But in the privacy of her bedroom, a singer was born, when Patti started performing using a broomstick as a microphone. Years before Lady Gaga and Madonna, Patti, along with Sarah Dash and Nona Hendryx, revolutionized music with their out-of-this-world fashion and over-the-top hairstyles. Their glam-rock girl group, Labelle, scored a number one hit with \"Lady Marmalade.\" When the women parted ways, Patti went solo, and despite crippling anxiety at her first show, she received a standing ovation and never looked back. A bestselling cookbook author, sweet potato pie queen and self-described cheesecake addict, Patti took charge of her health and made drastic changes to her diet after being diagnosed with diabetes, the same disease that contributed to her mother's death. She also discusses the deaths of her three sisters from cancer, and shares how their deaths influence the way she lives her life. Patti has a recurring role on this season of OWN\u2019s hit show Greenleaf, playing the part of Maxine Patterson, a famous Christian motivational speaker and the CEO of a global, faith-based self-help empire.",

Before she was the Queen of Country, Reba grew up on a ranch in Chockie, Oklahoma, a town with a population of 18. Growing up on a ranch meant that, early on, Reba learned the value of hard work and doing the job right. This work ethic stayed with her from her early days singing at rodeos to the stellar success to come. Reba's journey has taught her many things, and sometimes the lessons were hard-won. In 1991, when eight of her band members were killed in an airplane crash, Reba learned just how precious life is and how important it is to cherish each day.
