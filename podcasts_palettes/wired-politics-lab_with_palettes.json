Last week, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/\">twitter.com</a> became <a href=\"http://x.com/\">x.com</a>, marking the final step in a rebranding effort that the company\u2019s owner, Elon Musk, announced last year. The change marks a shift for the now bird-less app under Musk\u2019s reign, which has welcomed Nazis and white supremacists back onto the platform, dissolved its Trust and Safety council, and become a cesspool of disinformation and conspiracy. Meanwhile, people seem to still long for authentic connection\u2014like with the Dublin to New York portal that connects the cities through a live video stream. Today on WIRED Politics Lab, we trace Twitter's demise, and delve into what the rise of the portal could mean for the evolution of how we talk to each other and consume politics online.Leah Feiger is @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/leahfeiger?lang=en\">LeahFeiger</a>.

Kennedy Jr. officially launched his presidential campaign, his extreme conspiracies and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/rfk-jr-presidential-campaign-online/\">very online outreach</a> tactics have added up to a pretty effective independent bid. Today on Wired Politics Lab, we look into how RFK Jr. continues to build a following. We talk about his recent <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/rfk-jr-has-assembled-his-anti-vax-conspiracy-squad/\">VP pick, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Nicole Shanahan</a>, his media outreach, and the staff behind it all. And, of course, how his push for ballot access in the US might make him a spoiler candidate in the 2024 election.You can find more from Makena Kelly on RFK Jr. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/author/makena-kelly/\">here</a>, and from Anna Merlan <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/author/anna-merlan/\">here</a>.
