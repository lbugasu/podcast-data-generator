Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. As of 9/26/24, the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across the Bond Account is greater than 6%. A bond\u2019s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore, a bond\u2019s YTW is not \u201clocked in\u201d until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The \u201clocked in\u201d YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond.

Fast-forward to 2024, and weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy have complicated these issues even further.\u00a0\nThis week, listeners share stories and questions about dating, romance, sex, and self-love in the Ozempic era, and we\u2019ve assembled a panel of experts to respond. Ronald Young Jr. is the host of Weight For It, a podcast about the conversations that we tend to avoid when it comes to our bodies. Anna Holmes wrote about her experience with the weight loss drug Mounjaro for Slate (and she is also executive producer for the exciting new podcast, The Wonder of Stevie). Jill Lewis is a body-positive therapist based in Atlanta.

Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. As of 9/26/24, the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across the Bond Account is greater than 6%. A bond\u2019s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore, a bond\u2019s YTW is not \u201clocked in\u201d until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The \u201clocked in\u201d YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our Fee Schedule. Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. See https://public.com/disclosures/bond-account to learn more.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

She\u2019s probably best known for her biggest hit to date, \u201cWild Night,\u201d a Van Morrison cover she recorded with John Mellancamp back in 1994. Meshell is 55 now and just put out her 11th solo album, \u201cThe Omnichord Real Book,\u201d her first in five years. The album started as a kind of personal pandemic project before she decided to share it with the world, and it\u2019s now been nominated for a Best Alternative Jazz Album Grammy award.\nWhen Anna spoke with Meshell, she was just back from a quick European tour, and they talked about what it was like for her to grow up in the 70s and 80s in the Washington D.C. area, surrounded by music, and how she found the bass, her main instrument, by chance (and with a little help from Prince.) In this episode, Meshell shares how her life with music has evolved through the years, what she\u2019s learned to let go of \u2013 as a performer, as a mother and a daughter \u2013 and how the \u2018musical transmissions\u2019 that she receives help her stay grounded and present to who she really is, moment to moment.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                    "itunes:summary": "When Giulia Lukach had her first manic episode, it seemed to come out of nowhere. She was in her late twenties, and had been married to her husband, Mark, for three years. \u201cFor him it was just so new because I\u2019ve always been the happy girl,\u201d Giulia told Anna in an interview in 2015. Her psychosis was dark and intense.\u201c The only thing she could talk about was the devil and that she needed to protect the world because the devil was inside her,\u201d Mark said in their 2015 interview.\nIn 2023, Mark and Giulia sat down with Anna again. In the intervening years, they had a second child, and after years without Giulia having a manic episode, they thought they were in the clear. \u201cWe had this quasi-pseudo-science theory that maybe by sharing our story with the world, that was becoming this like protective barrier,\u201d Mark told Anna. In this episode, you\u2019ll hear parts of the couple\u2019s original 2015 conversation, and how their outlook has changed since, both in how they treat each other, and how they deal with the unknown. \u201cI have been to war with myself and with my mind many times,\u201d Giulia said, \u201cknowing that my episodes can come at any moment \u2013 that's like high anxiety for me \u2013 and so I literally live in the moment now. I only live in today.\u201d\nAlso, side note: Will you be in New York City on Saturday, December 9th at 12:30pm? Come to a Death, Sex, & Money live event at Caveat, a cabaret on the Lower East Side, to celebrate the show\u2019s run at WNYC. We\u2019re calling it Four Interviews and a Funeral. Join Anna, the team, special guests, and dance along to live music. Tickets are available here.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
