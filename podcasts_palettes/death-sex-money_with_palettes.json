                "summary": "When Giulia Lukach had her first manic episode, it seemed to come out of nowhere. She was in her late twenties, and had been married to her husband, Mark, for three years. \u201cFor him it was just so new because I\u2019ve always been the happy girl,\u201d Giulia told Anna in an interview in 2015. Her psychosis was dark and intense.\u201c The only thing she could talk about was the devil and that she needed to protect the world because the devil was inside her,\u201d Mark said in their 2015 interview.\nIn 2023, Mark and Giulia sat down with Anna again. In the intervening years, they had a second child, and after years without Giulia having a manic episode, they thought they were in the clear. \u201cWe had this quasi-pseudo-science theory that maybe by sharing our story with the world, that was becoming this like protective barrier,\u201d Mark told Anna. In this episode, you\u2019ll hear parts of the couple\u2019s original 2015 conversation, and how their outlook has changed since, both in how they treat each other, and how they deal with the unknown. \u201cI have been to war with myself and with my mind many times,\u201d Giulia said, \u201cknowing that my episodes can come at any moment \u2013 that's like high anxiety for me \u2013 and so I literally live in the moment now. I only live in today.\u201d\nAlso, side note: Will you be in New York City on Saturday, December 9th at 12:30pm? Come to a Death, Sex, & Money live event at Caveat, a cabaret on the Lower East Side, to celebrate the show\u2019s run at WNYC. We\u2019re calling it Four Interviews and a Funeral.
