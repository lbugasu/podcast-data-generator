Plus as always, we wrap with extended carve outs (joined this year by some surprise guests) for anyone still shopping for those holiday perfect gifts.</p><p>Huge thank you to everyone for making 2023 an amazing year again here in Acquired-land, and cheers to even greater things to come in 2023!</p><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:<br></strong><br>Anrok: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/anrokacquired\">https://bit.ly/anrokacquired</a><br>WorkOS: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/workos25\">https://bit.ly/workos25</a><br>Statsig: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24\">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>More Acquired!:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.acquired.fm/email\">Get email updates</a> with hints on next episode and follow-ups from recent episodes</li><li><a href=\"http://acquired.fm/slack\">Join the Slack</a></li><li><a href=\"https://pod.link/acquiredlp\">Subscribe to ACQ2</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.acquired.fm/store\">Merch Store</a>!</li></ul><p>\u00a9 Copyright 2015-2025 ACQ, LLC</p><br><p><strong>Links / Extended Carve Outs!</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-hardback-Timeless-happiness/dp/0857199099/\">The Psychology of Money</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-25th-Anniversary/dp/0143129252/\">The Artist\u2019s Way</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Transitions-Making-Sense-Lifes-Changes-ebook/dp/B07QGRGDKJ\">Transitions</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555\">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R4HKIV8/\">Zojirushi hot water heater</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.nike.com/t/pegasus-trail-4-gore-tex-mens-waterproof-trail-running-shoes-qdcSR6\">Nike Pegasus Trail 4 GORE-TEX</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.mill.com\">Mill</a></li><li><a href=\"https://juneoven.com\">June Oven</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/\">Silo</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285333/\">Alias</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com/eyeglasses/amari/arabica-matte?w=medium\">Warby Parker Amari glasses</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.hoka.com/en/us/recovery-comfort-shoes/ora-recovery-shoe-2/1119397.html?dwvar_1119397_color=BBLC\">Hoka Ora recovery shoes</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom/\">Adobe Light Room</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/01/science-technology-vaccine-invention-history/672227/\">The Eureka Theory of Everything is Wrong</a> by Derek Thompson</li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Luxury-Strategy-Break-Marketing-Brands/dp/0749464917\">The Luxury Strategy</a></li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide\">Candide</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheQBSchool\">The QB School</a></li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manningcast\">MNF ManningCast</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28814949/\">The Eras Tour</a></li><li><a href=\"https://uppababy.com/strollers/full-size/vista-v2/jake/\">Uppababy Vista</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.joolz.com/us/en/strollers/310110-M.html\">The Joolz Aer Plus</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/\">Coco</a></li><li><a href=\"https://atpresent.com\">At Present</a></li></ul><p><em>\u200dNote: Acquired hosts and guests may hold assets discussed in this episode.

Over the past 18 months Nvidia has weathered one of the steepest stock crashes in history ($500B+ market cap wiped away peak-to-trough!). And, it has of course also experienced an even more fantastical rise \u2014 becoming the platform that\u2019s powering the emergence of perhaps a new form of intelligence itself\u2026 and in the process becoming a trillion-dollar company.</p><p>Today we tell another chapter in the amazing Nvidia saga: the dawn of the AI era.

Pull up a chair, grab a beverage (or energy drink in David\u2019s case) and join us!</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://pod.link/founders\">Go subscribe to Founders!</a> Some of our favorite episodes: <a href=\"https://pod.link/founders/episode/820a5119b72b76b210df24e7a4a8e1bf\">Bernard Arnault</a>, <a href=\"https://pod.link/founders/episode/41a47a7535026098511ae2c16ff22804\">Brunello Cucinelli</a>, <a href=\"https://pod.link/founders/episode/b5637cb4b83ff459da8d05d804cf636f\">Edwin Land</a>, <a href=\"https://pod.link/founders/episode/bda7f5dbc148b894f7ba4ad494e45460\">Kobe Bryant</a></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:<br></strong><br>Anrok: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/anrokacquired\">https://bit.ly/anrokacquired</a><br>WorkOS: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/workos25\">https://bit.ly/workos25</a><br>Statsig: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24\">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>More Acquired!:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.acquired.fm/email\">Get email updates</a> with hints on next episode and follow-ups from recent episodes</li><li><a href=\"http://acquired.fm/slack\">Join the Slack</a></li><li><a href=\"https://pod.link/acquiredlp\">Subscribe to ACQ2</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.acquired.fm/store\">Merch Store</a>!</li></ul><p>\u00a9 Copyright 2015-2025 ACQ, LLC</p><br><strong>Topics:<br></strong><em>Note: Acquired hosts and guests may hold assets discussed in this episode.

You can read them below or at: <a href=\"http://www.acquired.fm/episodes/eventbrite\">www.acquired.fm/episodes/eventbrite</a></p><p>Playbook</p><ul><li>Seeing the next technology wave before others do is rare. It provides a roadmap for what to build and invest in if you're willing to bet on that knowledge.\u00a0<ul><li>Kevin worked at Silicon Graphics in the mid 90's. This led him to realize that internet services like PayPal, YouTube, and many others would be possible long before others (similar to Don Valentine realizing computers would penetrate every industry from his time at Fairchild).</li></ul></li><li>PayPal and its subsequent \"mafia\" was successful in part because of rapid experimentation. They observed what got used by customers and then doubled down.\u00a0<ul><li>PayPal's \"core\" use case on eBay started as an experiment. International money transfer (Xoom) and event ticketing (Eventbrite) also initially started as experiments on the PayPal API before the eBay acquisition \u2014 and went on to become large companies.</li><li>Julia, Kevin, and their cofounder Renaud had a prototype of Eventbrite running and serving customers even before starting the company \u2014 which gave them the confidence to do what seemed crazy on paper, but was actually \"de-risked\": start a company as an engaged couple, have a remote technical cofounder, bootstrap for 2 years after being turned down by VCs, etc.</li><li>When a company is experiencing explosive growth, they often need to leave other huge opportunities on the table. PayPal knew international remittances could be huge, but didn't build it internally because of the need to focus on eBay merchants.</li></ul></li><li>The TAM for bringing an offline behavior offline is often WAY bigger than anything you can calculate beforehand. The range and size of what were previously niche or impossible use cases will often expand dramatically with easy-to-use online tools. This is especially true in long-tail use cases that can only be aggregated by self-serve internet-based software.\u00a0<ul><li>One early encouraging sign for Eventbrite was its use to host speed dating events in New York. Before Eventbrite, it was nearly impossible to organize, promote, and charge for something like that. Now, organizers could suddenly become entrepreneurs and make real money hosting events like this. Most VCs ignored or were confused by this data (~\"Call us when you attack Ticketmaster.\"), but they missed that it unlocked a massive new market which previously operated only through word-of-mouth and cash transactions (if at all).</li><li>All three major dislocations of the 21st century \u2014 the tech bubble bursting in 2001, the financial crisis in 2008, and now COVID in 2020 \u2014 have only accelerated offline behaviors to online. COVID is unlocking a new wave of online event entrepreneurs for Eventbrite in the same way the financial crisis unlocked a wave of in-person event entrepreneurs in 2008-10.</li></ul></li><li>Starting with just one niche can be incredibly powerful; often your customers will then lead you to more.\u00a0<ul><li>Before the speed-dating in New York (which was fully inbound), Eventbrite was used to organize tech meetups in the then-smaller tech community in SF. It was even used for the first TechCrunch Disrupt!</li></ul></li><li>Too much capital (and too little accountability) can hurt a company much more than help it.

Dozens of the best podcasters on the internet (e.g., Patrick at Invest Like the Best, Levar Burton, Cory Doctorow, J.D. Vance, etc.) are creating exclusive content for the festival, with all proceeds going to COVID-19 relief. As Glow puts it, Podapalooza is the 2020 version of Live-Aid: podcast hosts instead of rockers, pajamas at home instead of big hair on stage, but still the same purpose of supporting relief for the most important cause of this moment. We think it's a really great idea -- we've already bought our tickets and hope you do too. You can sign up at: https://www.podapalooza.org",

Our editors worked super hard to fix in post-production, but it\u2019s still not totally perfect. We hope you\u2019ll give it a listen regardless, and we\u2019re working on getting a transcript made ASAP, which we\u2019ll post to the website when it\u2019s ready.

                    "content:encoded": "<p><em>Hey Acquired listeners. A note about this show: we recorded this episode the night before the 2016 Election Day in the US. At the time, the biggest change we saw coming was adding a new type of content to Acquired in analyzing IPO\u2019s, which we introduce in this episode. Two days later, we woke up to a very different world than the one we were expecting. Reflecting on what\u2019s happened, and the past few months of our show, we wanted to say two things:<br></em><br></p><p><em>First, we want to apologize for our cavalier attitude toward this election cycle, and our glossing over the clearly very real problems and deep divide in America that it represented. In the Skype episode, David pretty glibly compared the AT&amp;T - Time Warner merger to \"Make America Great Again\", arguing that any reactionary force is \u201con the wrong side of history\u201d and cannot be relevant in a changing world. That was wrong, the sentiment behind it was wrong, and it was insensitive to the very real pain a lot of people are feeling out there on both sides.</em></p><p><em>Second, looking back on this particular episode about the Facebook IPO, we think it actually might present a relevant parable for our country right now and--we hope--some important lessons for the technology industry going forward.
