Debunking myths (and strongly suggesting we skip heavily-marketed detox cleanses), Dr. Jen Gunter explains why having some yeast in the body is normal, how to know when it's a problem -- and what to (safely) do about it. For more on how your body works, tune into her podcast, Body Stuff with Dr. Jen Gunter, from the TED Audio Collective.",

Working to make this 400-billion-dollar-a-year supply chain process as efficient and sustainable as possible, freight expert Oren Zaslansky digs into the logistics of filling these trucks to their maximum capacity through algorithmic carpooling (think: ride-sharing your freight) -- bringing with it the potential of a more transparent and eco-friendly global supply chain.",

                    "itunes:summary": "After more than two decades as an anchor for ABC News, an on-air panic attack sent Dan Harris's life in a new direction: he became a dedicated meditator and, to some, even a guru. But then an anonymous survey of his family, friends and colleagues turned up some brutal feedback -- he was still kind of a jerk. In a wise, funny talk, he shares his years-long quest to improve his relationships with everyone (starting with himself) and explains the science behind loving-kindness meditation, and how it can boost your resiliency, quiet your inner critic and simply make you more pleasant to be around.",

Inviting you to reconsider your connection to dance, he shows how even everyday experiences -- tying your shoes, rocking a baby, whisking up some mac and cheese -- can offer choreographic inspiration and help you find joy and release when you need it most. After the talk, dancers Nico Lonetree and Ryan Spencer perform a dazzling routine infused with the humor and beauty of daily movements.",

                    "itunes:summary": "The world needs clean power, but decarbonization calls for a massive increase in the mining and extraction of minerals like lithium, graphite and cobalt. Environmental peacemaking expert Olivia Lazard sheds light on the scramble for these precious mineral resources -- and how the countries that control their supply chains (including China and Russia) could find themselves at the center of the new global stage. Learn why Lazard thinks planetary security depends on our ability to de-escalate resource competition and avoid the same mistakes that led to the climate crisis.",
