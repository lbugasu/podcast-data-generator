It tells the story of Jay Gardiner, a troubled young man burdened by guilt after the death of his estranged father. \nJay hopes to redeem himself by diving to recover his father's remains in the ocean off the California coast; instead he is swallowed whole by a whale.  It is in the whale's dark belly that Jay finally begins to reconcile with his father and understand the lessons he'd been trying to pass on. The book is not just a page-turning thriller but a deep meditation on fathers, sons and loss.\nLearn more about sponsor message choices: podcastchoices.com/adchoices\nNPR Privacy Policy",
