Its population hovers around 1,400 people. Reaching it requires a boat ride from Samoa that can take over 24 hours. To say that Tokelau is remote is an understatement: it was the last place on Earth to be connected to the telephone\u2026 in 1997.\n\nDespite its size, Tokelau has become an internet giant. Until recently, its .tk domain had more users than any other country\u2019s: a staggering 25 million. Yet only one website with a .tk domain is actually from Tokelau.

In the first of a four-part series on face recognition, Jennifer Strong and the team at MIT Technology Review explore the arrest of a man who was falsely accused of a crime using facial recognition. The episode also starts to unpack the complexities of this technology and introduce some thorny questions about its use.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe meet:\u00a0\nRobert and Melissa Williams\u00a0\nPeter Fussey, University of Essex\nHamid Khan, Stop LAPD Spying Coalition\n\nCredits: This episode was reported and produced by Jennifer Strong, Tate Ryan-Mosley and Emma Cillekens.

In some stores, sophisticated systems are tracking customers in almost every imaginable way, from recognizing their faces to gauging their age, their mood, and virtually gussying them up with makeup. The systems rarely ask for people\u2019s permission, and for the most part they don\u2019t have to. In our season 1 finale, we look at the explosion of AI and face recognition technologies in retail spaces, and what it means for the future of shopping.\n\nWe meet: \nRetailNext CTO Arun Nair,\nL'Oreal's Technology Incubator Global VP Guive Balooch,\nModiface CEO Parham Aarabi\nBiometrics pioneer and Chairman of ID4Africa Joseph Atick\n\nCredits: \nThis episode was reported and produced by Jennifer Strong, Anthony Green, Tate Ryan-Mosley, Emma Cillekens and Karen Hao.
