People with ADHD can seem restless, may have trouble concentrating and may act on impulse. https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/\n\n\n\nPMDD - Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a health problem that is similar to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) but is more serious. PMDD causes severe irritability, depression, or anxiety in the week or two before your period starts. Symptoms usually go away two to three days after your period starts.
