                    "description": "Humorist/writer Shalom Auslander's new memoir is a satirical look at all the ways a sense of \"feh,\" which is Yiddish for \"yuck,\" has made its way into his psyche and every aspect of his life. Auslander has written extensively over the years about growing up in a dysfunctional ultra-Orthodox Jewish family. His new memoir, aptly titled <em>Feh</em>, is about a journey to write a different story for himself.<br/><br/>We'll also hear from Julianne Nicholson. Proud to call herself a character actor, she's appeared in dozens of films and TV series, from <em>Ally McBeal </em>and <em>Boardwalk Empire </em>to <em>August: Osage County</em> and <em>Mare of Easttown</em>, where she earned an Emmy. Nicholson is starring in the new film <em>Janet Planet.<br/><br/></em>And, Ken Tucker takes us back 50 years to Stevie Wonder's album <em>Fulfillingness' First Finale, </em>which he says is an underrated treasure.<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",
