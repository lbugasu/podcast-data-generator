The incident lasted for four tense days and left 67 people dead. In this special episode of Focus on Africa, we'll hear from Valentine Kadzo and Shamim Allu who survived the Westgate attack. They talk about the impact it has had on their lives and how they managed to heal ten years later. We'll also speak to the BBC's Bushra Mohamed, who is a Kenyan-Somali and explains how her community has been affected by the incidents that followed the attack. And security analyst Dr. Hannah Macharia explains how the attack changed Kenya's counter-terrorism approach.</p>"
