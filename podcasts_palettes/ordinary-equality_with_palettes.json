            "description": "The Supreme Court has done the unimaginable, repealing the landmark Roe v. Wade decision and stripping Americans of a fundamental right: abortion access. On the latest season of Ordinary Equality, hosts Kate Kelly and Jamia Wilson ask: what now? What does resisting bans and seeking care look like in a world without federal protection of abortion access? How can we build community and support the most vulnerable? How are abortion providers in states where abortion was already severely restricted working around the system? Join us as we decipher the future of abortion access and explore the stories of survival and resistance in a post-Roe world.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

What does resisting bans and seeking care look like in a world without federal protection of abortion access? How can we build community and support the most vulnerable?
