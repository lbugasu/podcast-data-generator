In this episode I talk about heartbreak, grief, business challenges, relationship struggles, advice from Sir David Brailsford and protecting my mental health - all of it is unfiltered.\u00a0\n\nWhen I first started The Diary Of A CEO, the central idea of the show, was to read my personal diary every week \u2013 I believed that It might be interesting to get to see inside the very personal diary of someone that was running a business with hundreds of team members, at 25ish years old, while contending with all of life\u2019s problems, relationships, mental health challenges, mistakes, business issues, family problems, and more. So late on Sunday night once in a while, I would pull up a microphone in my old apartment, and I would read through my diary for 45 minutes or an hour.\n\nThe Diary Of A CEO took on a life of it\u2019s own, I went from reading my diary, to interviewing other people about their diaries, to speaking to experts about all the problems that I cared about.\n\nBut every single week, someone will come up to me and tell me they found value in those early episodes, and they\u2019ll ask me if I would ever share my diary again\u2026 So this weekend, I finally decided to give it go. This episode is my diary. The original, Diary Of A CEO.\u00a0\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://g2ul0.app.link/gnGqL4IsKKb\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\ude80 The 1% Diary is live - and it won\u2019t be around for long, so act fast!\u00a0https://bit.ly/1-Diary-Megaphone-ad-reads\n\nWatch the Guest episodes on Youtube - https://g2ul0.app.link/DOACEpisodes\u00a0\n\nFour tracks composed by:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/eejebee/\nLearn more about your ad choices.

This fat is a result of the stress hormone cortisol, which because of evolution, tells your body to hold onto fat as a survival mechanism. Because of this, you can\u2019t shift this belly weight with either diet or exercise, the only thing that will change it is addressing the stress that is causing the release of cortisol. Dr Swart also says that leaders who cannot handle their stress, who she calls, \u2018leaky cortisol people\u2019, can cause a trickle down effect in an organisation, causing stress and negative health impacts on the people below them.\n\nListen to the full episode here\nApple -\u00a0https://g2ul0.app.link/BIZuIuDPwIb\nSpotify -\u00a0https://g2ul0.app.link/NGE9aaHPwIb\n\nWatch the Episodes On Youtube: \u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/%20TheDiaryOfACEO/videos\n\nTara:\nInstagram: https://bit.ly/48hJ1k2\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/46gqYZI\nLearn more about your ad choices.

However, Logan says that it is possible for 25% of us to change our attachment style. She says this can be done in 2 parts: firstly by understanding your style of attachment, and secondly, by understanding your unconscious triggers you can override them in order to get out of your own way in finding love.\n\nListen to the full episode here \nApple - https://g2ul0.app.link/sXZ3OZpToHb\nSpotify - https://g2ul0.app.link/nAu4hnmToHb\n\nWatch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/%20TheDiaryOfACEO/videos\nLogan:\nhttps://www.loganury.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/loganury/?hl=en\nLearn more about your ad choices.

A habit forms when you\u2019ve done something so many times that it becomes hardwired into your subconscious, and is even programmed into the very nerve cells of your brain. So in order to break a habit, you have to break the bigger habit of being yourself. Dr Dispenza says that this change can happen when we become conscious of our unconscious. This awareness can come from meditation, as well as mentally rehearsing changes we want to make, so that we avoid the trap of unconsciously making the same choices everyday.

                    "description": "In this moment, New York Times best-selling author and researcher, Dr Joe Dispenza discusses how to change habits. A habit forms when you\u2019ve done something so many times that it becomes hardwired into your subconscious, and is even programmed into the very nerve cells of your brain. So in order to break a habit, you have to break the bigger habit of being yourself. Dr Dispenza says that this change can happen when we become conscious of our unconscious. This awareness can come from meditation, as well as mentally rehearsing changes we want to make, so that we avoid the trap of unconsciously making the same choices everyday. By mentally rehearsing scenarios, this avoids the uncomfortableness that comes from taking a step into the unknown and stops you from being the creator of your life.\n\nListen To The Full Episode Here -\u00a0https://g2ul0.app.link/3q2pKyW6gGb\nWatch The Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/%20TheDiaryOfACEO/videos\nJoe: https://drjoedispenza.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/drjoedispenza/\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Chris believes that the most important step for achieving confidence is to lead with action.

He has also been named as one of Time magazine\u2019s 100 most influential people in the world.\nAfter studying medicine in India, Deepak moved to America to begin his medical career.

Some people would say that you must gain a whole new variety of skills and knowledge to keep up in our fast moving times. Only a few people would say you should use strategies that haven\u2019t changed in thousands of years, as human nature and the game of power hasn\u2019t changed either.\nBest-selling author Robert Greene is one of these few people. Ever since he was a child he has been fascinated with seeing behind the polite masks that humans show to each other in civilised society, whilst underneath these disguises we all share a darker side and cravings for power.\nIn this enlightening conversation Robert Greene discusses his life\u2019s work, from the rules of power and seduction, to mastery and human nature. Robert explores how we can use the lessons of history to succeed in all areas of life.\n\nRobert Greene:\nInstagram:\nhttp://bit.ly/3LFt2n9\nWebsite:\nhttp://bit.ly/3TIptyr\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo\nLearn more about your ad choices.

From a top class player to one its best television pundits, Jamie has devoted his life and career to the sport. \nFrom a working class upbringing as a Bootle boy to \u201cMr Liverpool\u201d, Jamie has always stayed loyal to his roots and to the city that nurtured and supported him in reaching the heights that his career soared to.

Allowing the space and culture within companies for people to be who they are and know what matters to them leads people to becoming higher performers.

In this moment, Bear Grylls tells us how to find lasting confidence. It\u2019s incredible to think that someone like Bear - who\u2019s a veteran of the SAS and conquered every challenge nature has had throw at him - struggles with Imposter Syndrome, but in this clip he reveals his journey to find confidence. Real confidence, according to Bear, comes from accepting that life will humble you, that life is often a battle, that sometimes you\u2019ll lose as well as win. Only then can you appreciate the importance of doing your best, or DYB as Bear calls it. Because really going for things that we want without fear is, in the end, all we can do.

One of the best actors of his generation, with honours from Queen Elizabeth to prove it, David\u2019s road to the top had to overcome his psychosis, which at one point drove him to the point of insanity and left him sectioned into a psychiatric hospital. \nWith his life as he knew it on the brink, David rebuilt his life and career to reach the very top of the entertainment business. Scars like this take time to mend, and sometimes leave unexpected traces. David is controversially honest that losing his mind, in a way, helped him find his creativity. This isn\u2019t the message that everyone wants to hear, but David\u2019s frankness about how his darkest times set him apart from everyone else is a story you don\u2019t want to miss.\n\nFollow David:\nInstagram: https://bit.ly/3CLLi9F\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/3MmT5xQ\nDavid's book: https://amzn.to/3RI13m4\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo\nLearn more about your ad choices.

In this moment Mo Gawdat lays out a philosophy for how to admit when you\u2019re wrong, and the right way to go about setting priorities in your life. As Mo powerfully says, \u201850% of what I know is wrong\u2019, and this is true for everyone. Coming to life from this position of humbleness is the only way we can truly get our head straight on what our life is and where it\u2019s taking us. There are things that you need, like food and human interaction, and there are things that you want, like status or expensive possessions. Interrogating the insecurity in our wants and why we really want them is the best way to be at peace with ourselves, and to cut out toxic habits from our life.

In this moment, Simon Sinek talks about how we can find purpose in our lives through attaching it to causes bigger than ourselves. There are things that we can achieve by ourselves, but true satisfaction and real pride in our achievements always comes from being part of a team or a collective. A wider cause or a group we care about is the only thing that would cause us to make real sacrifices. Simon\u2019s thought long and hard about how we can take projects in the workplace and in our social lives and infuse them with real meaning for everyone involved with them. What\u2019s emerged is a profound meditation on where human satisfaction really comes from, and a step by step guide on how to bring these principles into your life.

That cancer is just one of the things that has held Nicola back, but, like her struggle against racial prejudice in her early years, she hasn\u2019t let it define her. No one is ever going to get to define Nicola except her.\nIn this candid chat about how she\u2019s seen her role and her company change as it\u2019s come under increasing criticism in the last few years, Nicola holds nothing back on her critics, her fears, her highs, her lows, and what she still wants herself and the company to achieve.\n\nFollow Nicola:\nTwitter - https://g2ul0.app.link/t9DYxjBKqsb\nInstagram - https://g2ul0.app.link/xf4gYKzsvsb\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Far too many people are afraid of just following their instincts to what makes them happiest and most fulfilled. Jonny Wilkinson doesn\u2019t have time for any of that, or for following the expectations other people set. Jonny is interested in what makes you unique, and he thinks you should be too.

He scaled as high as it\u2019s possible to go in world rugby, but he found the process demoralising, and he wasn\u2019t happy.

Never afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve in his work, his artistry has helped millions of people articulate feelings in their own heart of love, regret, and friendships made and ended.\nHe\u2019s definitely come a long way from the small town where he grew up, which he escaped through grasping every opportunity that came his way. There\u2019s perhaps no industry tougher to succeed in than music, and this fear that there\u2019s only a few that make it has haunted him at every step.\nSo settle down and let James walk you through every step of what the creative process looks like at the elite level - where inside him it comes from, what inspires it, and how he delivers his music. James\u2019 new album \u2018Leap\u2019 is out now.\n\nFollow James:\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/JamesBayMusic\u00a0\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/jamesbaymusic/ \nJames\u2019 new album:\u00a0https://www.jamesbay.com \n\nFollow me:\nhttps://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo\nLearn more about your ad choices.

In this moment I talk to Marcus about how we are supposed to build a great career that we love.\u00a0The three main question points we all ask ourselves when we are in a working role is the \u2018who\u2019, the \u2018what\u2019 and the \u2018why\u2019.

The \u2018who\u2019 is also crucial. Working with people you like, being in a great team, and amongst inspiring people plays a powerful role in our work.

Where does the line blur between a hard-driving start-up and a toxic culture. It\u2019s a tricky balance many challenger companies have to contend with. James\u2019 is a story where he sailed a little close to the wind, when the revelations dropped it looked like everything he built could slip away. Can he navigate Brewdog back to dry land? He tells us exclusively how he plans to. \n\nFollow James:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/brewdogjames\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BrewDogJames\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo\nLearn more about your ad choices.

With it being Men\u2019s Mental Health Awareness Month, I felt it was important in this week\u2019s moment to focus on the importance of checking in with this prevalent topic in our current society. Roman Kemp tells us about the time he nearly lost his life, and how he was saved by a simple phone call from his mother checking up on him. Suffering from depression since he was a teenager, Roman has sometimes had trouble finding balance in his life. Thankfully, no one knew the ins and outs of his struggle like his mother. When she phoned him up asking how he was doing, he gave her an answer she was not expecting. She would never have imagined having to receive something like this from her son. Simple check ups with our friends and loved ones can have much more impact than we ever anticipate. Likewise, being open about our feelings can help to change them if they\u2019ve gone down a bad path. I hope this moment from our conversation will help you to open up with your friends, and make this something normal to talk about.

One of the first skincare brands when it launched in the 1980s, Jane got people to care about something they didn\u2019t realise was important. \nToday she finally tells her incredible story in this conversation and in her new book, Skin in the Game. Jane\u2019s story to self-independence begins when she was in a toxic relationship with a controlling boyfriend, in a strange country she knew little about. She describes feeling the physical hand of her late father on her shoulder guiding her where to go next. She picked herself up, and with a new partner used her new business as a fresh chapter in her life. Then, her industry was just one clinic in Los Angeles. Now, it\u2019s a chain worth billions. Jane lit the touchpaper on a revolution, and in finding her own confidence, Jane helped millions of others find theirs too. \n\nFollow Jane:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/janewurwand\nJane\u2019s book -  https://bit.ly/3KfGpqt \nDermalogica - https://bit.ly/3uWKitZ \n\nFollow me:\nhttps://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Through the techniques she offers in this conversation, people can get through a breakup or a rough patch at work without it knocking them back.

This is a moment from my episode with Jay Shetty, the best-selling author of Think Like a Monk, host of the No. 1 podcast On Purpose and one of the most wise people I have ever met. Very few people can reach into depths of insight on such a wide array of topics like he does. I learnt so many things I didn't even realise I needed to know from this conversation, and I know you will too - this being one of them. Meditation. A difficult one to get on board with.\u00a0We always hear that we must meditate more, but we never really practice it. Why? Because it's too woo-woo, or time wasting. Well here, Jay explains how much meditation can add value to our lives. All we have to do is put a time in our schedule that is time for us. Even if it\u2019s 5 minutes a day, when we get that notification, we have to do something with it.\u00a0The second step of meditation and taking time for ourselves is focusing on our breath. It's wildly underestimated yet it's one of the most important aspects of the human body.

Mel is the author of The Five Second Rule, a business woman, a life coach, and a sensation in the world of self improvement. At a point in her life Mel was really struggling with huge amounts of depression, anxiety, and fear, making it extremely difficult for her to get out of bed in the morning and generally just be present in her life. This moment describes the method that has changed Mel\u2019s mindset to become who she is today. Mel got herself out of her dark side which saw her marinating in fear and anxiety, using her Five Second Rule. The rule was born from that window of hesitation that comes into our minds before we make a decision, a decision that could define your whole life. Inside that window lives fear, anxiety, procrastination and imposter syndrome, so we create patterns of feeling, patterns of behaviour, and patterns of thinking that tempt us to steer away from making that decision.\u00a0It can be a dangerous cycle getting stuck in these broken patterns of denial so Mel brings this down to one fundamental method. The Five Second rule works because of its simplicity. You make yourself a promise, you count backwards - 5,4,3,2,1 then you do it.

This was an incredibly engaging conversation, as he tells me how he manages to squeeze every moment from his day.\u00a0Ali mentions here that in order to do our tasks in the most efficient way, we should shift our mindset to think they are fun.

Shifting our mind to think that something is fun, will make us feel so much better about ourselves once the task is done.\u00a0I also mentioned that when I have my own time to choose when I can be productive, I create time sensitive and task specific blocks in my mind.

This week, I have chosen a clip from my episode with Rochelle Humes, who spoke to me so openly about her life, chasing the highest goals like never before. Rochelle has been performing professionally and presenting television since she was in school, and is also the entrepreneur behind innovative hair and skincare brand My Little Coco. Rochelle found success by being true to herself, and following her instincts. We all know this can be hard to do, so here we talk about how to make those decisions easier. The 51% theory is something that I learnt off Barack Obama at a talk we both did in Brazil. It comes down to if we are always looking for 100% of the facts, data and certainty to get our decisions over the line, it leads to huge procrastination and time-wasting. Getting to that 51% is a much more efficient system, and it reassures us that it will be the right decision to make.

This week, I have chosen a clip from my episode with Rochelle Humes, who spoke to me so openly about her life, chasing the highest goals like never before. Rochelle has been performing professionally and presenting television since she was in school, and is also the entrepreneur behind innovative hair and skincare brand My Little Coco. Rochelle found success by being true to herself, and following her instincts. We all know this can be hard to do, so here we talk about how to make those decisions easier. The 51% theory is something that I learnt off Barack Obama at a talk we both did in Brazil. It comes down to if we are always looking for 100% of the facts, data and certainty to get our decisions over the line, it leads to huge procrastination and time-wasting. Getting to that 51% is a much more efficient system, and it reassures us that it will be the right decision to make.

Fearne Cotton is an author, presenter and podcast host with a goal to help all of her listeners find their own happy place. In this clip, we talk about one section of her book that hones in on the idea of being more self-compassionate. It's something I\u2019ve spoken about a lot, talking about this voice inside our heads that talks to us. What Fearne says here is that we need to choose what we listen to, and what we focus on. We need to focus on the stuff that we like about ourselves and the things that we really want to celebrate. It\u2019s a matter of where we put our attention and focus, and that is a hard practical discipline that we need to work on. It\u2019s so important that we learn to become more self-compassionate.

Here we discuss the common misconceptions many people have about sleep, including the much perceived importance of getting those 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night. Her main piece of advice denotes that perfection is the enemy of the good; dictating our bedtime is the worst thing we can do to ourselves, and instead we should focus on the quality over the quantity of sleep and never expect to get that solid 8 hours that we have all been told to get.\u00a0Finding a reasonable sleep routine, and maintaining it will allow our bodies to regulate and rest, which will eventually train the brain to use our sleep window as a sleep opportunity. Such an overload of misconceptions can go wrong, and cause even more panic for people who have become crippled by their sleep patterns.

From humble beginnings in Norwich to one of the largest internet personalties working in Britain today, Jack has had a hell of a ride.\nBut more thought goes into Jack\u2019s comedy and its targets than you might think. Because Jack doesn\u2019t just mock anyone, but is always interrogating himself as to whether he\u2019s mocking the right targets, and whether there\u2019s a sufficient \u2018why?\u2019 to everything he does. His ride to the top hasn\u2019t been easy either, and Jack has had to overcome challenges he never expected along the way. From anxiety to dealing with criticism, Jack gives us the truth about inventing, and then reinventing, yourself on the internet. \n\nFollow Jack:\nTwitter -\u00a0https://twitter.com/Jaack\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0BjnjltT8FEZyN3Iw5mN0Q\u00a0\nThe rapper NF that Jack Refers to - https://www.youtube.com/c/NFrealmusicvideos/videos \n\nFollow me:\nhttps://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Here he shares his wisdom about how we can form healthy habits and ways in which to maintain them.

When we look to battle those good habits from the bad, it is not straightforward, and they need to be subdivided.\u00a0Steve is the author of \u201cThe Chimp Paradox\u201d, which has sold millions of copies worldwide and put forward the groundbreaking \u2018Chimp model\u2019 for understanding how our brains work. The model focuses on the 3 parts of the brain and he talks briefly about one of them here. The \u2018Chimp\u2019 which is our desire to be irrational, emotional, impulsive and short-term.

Nick Jenkins is the founder and former CEO of Moonpig.com, a company which revolutionised gift cards and is now worth over one and a half billion pounds. In this moment, Nick shares his wisdom with us on the importance of having good communication skills from public speaking to stand-out graphics and polished writing. Your ability to articulate yourself, think coherently and coerce a logical argument is vital to all walks of life whether that is business related or not. People often think that to be a good communicator you have to nail those public speaking events, but what Nick notes is that actually we practice articulating ourselves everyday. Making eye contact, engaging in conversations and listening to people are all things we can do. The more we output, whether that be speaking, writing or drawing the better we naturally become at communicating with people. We compare this to sales because at the baseline, we are always selling ourselves to people we meet, persuading others that we are the best. Nick is an incredible guy who leans on the power of composing yourself well in front of others in order to succeed.

In these \u2018Moment\u2019 episodes of my podcast I usually pick one of my favourite moments across all the episodes, but this week after the heartbreaking news of Jamal\u2019s passing I wanted to collate the best bits of our conversation into a mini montage as a dedication to the prodigious person he was. I hope we can all live in the legacy he left behind. Jamal Edwards played a huge role in my life, he was someone that I admired and looked up to tremendously. He paved the way and proved to young black men like me that I could become successful and achieve big things. Jamal is the founder of SBTV, the first new media business on YouTube, which is hugely successful, and plays a role in launching the careers of many, many people in the music industry, including Ed Sheeran. He talks here about the dimensions of being an entrepreneur, and how the mistakes we make often create the biggest hurdles to overcome and learn from. His wisdom and maturity are inspiring to listen to and as we delve into the subject of achieving happiness, he says his own happiness comes from being able to give back, to improve other people\u2019s lives and to give people the confidence and self-belief he wished he had. We recorded this clip over a year ago, and I wanted to share with you moments from it that capture his genuine empathy, charisma and diligence.

This particular moment was taken from an episode where I asked you guys to send in questions you wanted answering. This one really stood out to me as its a question I get so often, yet I think people are looking at imposter syndrome in completely the wrong way. Facing the feeling of being outside our comfort zone is a challenge to overcome, but with the right mindset we can turn those nerves around into something positive. When you feel butterflies in your stomach, my evidence and interpretation of this nervousness tells me I am ready to do the thing that is instinctively making you anxious. Despite associating imposter syndrome with fear, I strongly believe that it is a good feeling to have. Growth requires us to step outside of our comfort zone, to push ourselves and expand our abilities. Each time you do this, the next time will be just that little bit easier. What people call imposter syndrome is a sign you're exactly where you are supposed to be. Though short I felt this was a moment that couldn't be missed.

Jimmy Carr needs no introduction and is one of the biggest names in British comedy. Jimmy has hardly been off our screens for the last two decades.

Mo has co-founded over 20 businesses, he\u2019s the author of the ground-breaking \u2018Solve for Happy\u2019 and he was chief business officer of the pioneering wing of google, Google X, the \u2018moonshot factory\u2019 where they work on all the latest technologies like self-driving cars and robots.

When his son died, this sent him on an incredible journey to look within himself and find the \u2018happiness equation\u2019, a simple technique that can help us all reduce our unhappiness and appreciate life, and ourselves, more. Mo Gawdat\u2019s episode simply blew me away. There were so many hard-hitting truths which he exposed about happiness, but this clip might just have the best of them all. Happiness is a choice. This is something not everyone is willing to accept. But as you\u2019ll hear in this moment episode, you can only be happy once you choose to be.

It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, what you\u2019ve gone through or where you decide to go, there is always a way to achieve what truly matters most to you.\u00a0Episode 92 - https://g2ul0.app.link/VBEo4l8wcmb Holly: https://www.instagram.com/hollytucker/ https://holly.co/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos\nLearn more about your ad choices.

I\u2019ve selected six moments, from all the guests we\u2019ve had on, that offer the most life-changing advice.\nIf you\u2019re new to this podcast, this is definitely the place to start.\u00a0I found these moments the most meaningful, the most enlightening, and the most inspiring. From Elizabeth Day talking about the importance of failure, to Jamil Querishi talking about how you can find consistency, to Matthew Syed on building self-confidence and self-esteem.\nNo matter who you are or where you are in your life, you\u2019re sure to take something from this. We\u2019ve all been on an incredible journey with this podcast, where we hear the stories, the challenges, the highs and lows, of the world's most successful people.

By the age of 24 she had been a World Champion 3 times and competed at the Olympic Games. In 2010 she was awarded an MBE for her services to sport. Hemmings achieved this success against all the odds. She was told by the British head coach that she was not big enough or strong enough to be a great kayaker. She proved him wrong.</p><p>At the peak of her career, Anna was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\u00a0and was told by medical experts she might never race again. She battled her way to full recovery and went on to win a further 3 world titles and compete at her second Olympic Games in Beijing 2008. She has become an expert in the field of resilience and high performance. Anna is now an Executive coach and founded Beyond the Barriers, a high performance training consultancy which works globally with leaders and teams giving them practical tools and strategies to enable them to thrive under pressure, build resilience, be mentally tough in challenging environments and deliver world class performance.</p><p>Anna\u2019s sporting achievements were recognised at the Sunday Times Sports Woman of the Year Awards, where she won the 2005 Champions Award and then again in 2007 when she was voted BBC London Sports Personality of the Year. This week's podcast gave me more realisations than I\u2019ve ever had from a guest before. We spoke about the multiple challenges she faced throughout her career and how despite all of the hardships, she was able to keep going when all the signs were there to give-up. We also delved into her expertise in resilience and high performance, discussing the steps she takes to help people become the greatest version of themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Follow Anna: </p><p>Website - <a href=\"https://www.annahemmings.com/\">https://www.annahemmings.com/</a></p><p>LinkedIn - <a href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/anna-hemmings-mbe\">https://uk.linkedin.com/in/anna-hemmings-mbe</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow me:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo\">https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

Anna is Britain\u2019s most successful female marathon kayaker with a staggering eleven World and European Championship medals, 9 of them gold. By the age of 24 she had been a World Champion 3 times and competed at the Olympic Games. In 2010 she was awarded an MBE for her services to sport. Hemmings achieved this success against all the odds. She was told by the British head coach that she was not big enough or strong enough to be a great kayaker. She proved him wrong.\nAt the peak of her career, Anna was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\u00a0and was told by medical experts she might never race again. She battled her way to full recovery and went on to win a further 3 world titles and compete at her second Olympic Games in Beijing 2008. She has become an expert in the field of resilience and high performance. Anna is now an Executive coach and founded Beyond the Barriers, a high performance training consultancy which works globally with leaders and teams giving them practical tools and strategies to enable them to thrive under pressure, build resilience, be mentally tough in challenging environments and deliver world class performance.\nAnna\u2019s sporting achievements were recognised at the Sunday Times Sports Woman of the Year Awards, where she won the 2005 Champions Award and then again in 2007 when she was voted BBC London Sports Personality of the Year. This week's podcast gave me more realisations than I\u2019ve ever had from a guest before. We spoke about the multiple challenges she faced throughout her career and how despite all of the hardships, she was able to keep going when all the signs were there to give-up. We also delved into her expertise in resilience and high performance, discussing the steps she takes to help people become the greatest version of themselves.\n\nFollow Anna: \nWebsite - https://www.annahemmings.com/\nLinkedIn - https://uk.linkedin.com/in/anna-hemmings-mbe\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo\nLearn more about your ad choices.
