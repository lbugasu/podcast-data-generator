But what began as a utopian vision quickly turned sour when the founding family&rsquo;s son, Ervil LeBaron, struggled for control of the community and unleashed a multi-generational crimewave &ndash; the ripples of which are still being felt today.</p>\n<p>From bank robbery to drug smuggling, auto theft rings to multiple murders, a deadly cult evolved into a sophisticated organized crime family. In Deliver Us From Ervil, journalist Jesse Hyde tells the story of Ervil LeBaron and the unlikely ensemble of reporters, cops, survivors and family insiders trying to halt his bloody legacy.</p>\n<p>Deliver Us From Ervil is produced by Novel for iHeartRadio.</p>",
