Plus, she shares her experience transitioning from academia to industry.\u00a0\n\nRead the transcript of this episode here: https://www.possible.fm/podcasts/dkoller\n\nFor more info on the podcast and transcripts of all the episodes, visit https://www.possible.fm/podcast/\u00a0\n\nTopics:\n00:01: Cold open\n00:43: Hellos and intros\n3:20: Early involvement in AI\u00a0\n5:00: Overview of drug discovery and its evolution over the last five years\u00a0\n7:50: AI and machine learning impact on biology and drug development\u00a0\n9:09: Pi aside defining AlphaFold\u00a0\n11:37: Areas of acceleration and opportunity in AI and drug discovery\u00a0\n17:21: Synthetic data\u00a0\n21:21: AI implications on therapeutic hypotheses\u00a0\n23:54: Personalized vs. precision medicine\u00a0\n27:04: Closing the data feedback loop\u00a0\n30:31: Exciting announcements\u00a0\n34:24: Privacy and data\n36:41: GPT-4 story\u00a0\n38:48: Stuart Russell\u2019s comments on the applications of Koller\u2019s thesis\u00a0\n43:36: AI as a moving target\n47:24: How can academia and industry positively impact society and humanity\n51:58: insitro\u2019s culture\u00a0\n54:18: - Rapid-fire questions\n\nSelect mentions:\u00a0\nNot the End of the World: How We Can Be the First Generation to build a Sustainable Planet by Hannah Ritchie\n\nStuart Russell\n\n\nPossible is an award-winning podcast that sketches out the brightest version of the future\u2014and what it will take to get there.

Throughout her career, Maja has sought to understand human needs and desires in order to create the right kind of robot. How big should it be? Should it be a humanoid? Animal? Or\u2026 WALL-E? These questions lead to the nature of empathy itself\u2014and what it means for robots to be empathetic. Maja also responds to an AI-generated story that speculates on the role that a socially assistive robot could play for a multigenerational family.\n\nRead the transcript of this episode here.\nRead the AI story here.\nFor more info on the podcast and transcripts of all of the episodes, visit www.possible.fm/podcast.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTopics:\n03:30 - What inspired Maja to pursue robotics?\n06:09 - The pop culture perception of \u201cdoomsday robots\u201d\n07:32 - What are socially assistive robots?\n10:20 - How socially assistive robots can enhance our humanity\n12:55 - The relationship between an assistive robot and a human\n16:19 - The hardware side of AI\n20:05 - How our lives would look different with robots in them\n24:06 - Why physically embodied robots are important\n27:42 - AI story about intergenerational family and a robot assistant\n31:16 - How VR/AR can be integrated with AI\n38:34 - Rapidfire questions\n44:10 - Debrief with Reid and Aria\n\nPossible is a podcast that sketches out the brightest version of the future\u2014and what it will take to get there.
