    "description": "What if, in the future, everything breaks humanity's way? Possible is an award-winning, weekly podcast that sketches out the brightest version of the future\u2014and what it will take to get there. Hosts Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger explore what\u2019s possible with forward-thinking leaders, deep thinkers, and ambitious builders across many fields, such as technology, art, education and healthcare. These conversations center on the ways technology\u2014and, in particular, AI\u2014is shaping the future. In episodes, AI tools such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and Inflection\u2019s Pi are at work, offering informational asides, prompting guests, or demoing what they can do. Lastly, between guest episodes, Aria interviews her co-host Reid on his latest takes on what\u2019s possible if we use technology\u2014and our collective effort\u2014effectively.",

Elliot and Hyman Minsky, and more.\n\nThis speech was originally given by Reid Hoffman in English on May 24, 2024 after accepting an honorary doctorate from the University of Perugia. It\u2019s also been translated and delivered by REID AI (an AI version of Reid Hoffman) in nine different languages.
