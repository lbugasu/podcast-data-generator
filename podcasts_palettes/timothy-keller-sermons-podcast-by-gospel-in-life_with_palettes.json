Jonah runs away because he hates the dirty pagan Ninevites. He doesn\u2019t think they can change and he doesn\u2019t care enough to want them to change. But then, Jonah ends up sacrificing himself for dirty pagan sailors. The very truth missing from Jonah\u2019s mind and heart is imparted even as God seeks him.\nLet\u2019s see what this shows us about how we should regard the world. Here is what the sailors teach us: 1) every human being has a deep, spiritual longing, but 2) in our natural state our deep, spiritual longings are distorted by fear.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 5, 1990.

                "summary": "Freedom is the greatest value in the modern Western world. The secular model of freedom is basically freedom from something. It says, \u201cI am only free when there\u2019s nothing in my way.\u201d\nWhen people come to Christianity, they would like inspiration and help, but they don\u2019t want to give up their freedom. Very often, Christians say to them, \u201cYou must give it up. God has a will,\u201d but the Bible doesn\u2019t come at it like that at all. The Bible instead is dripping with the language of freedom.\nSo let\u2019s look at what this text shows us about 1) the failure of secular freedom, and 2) the nature of real Christian freedom.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 5, 1998. Series: Galatians: New Freedom, New Family. Scripture: Galatians 5:5-18.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

We have filters based on our experiences and cultures.\nSo before we pick at this passage in Ephesians 5, let\u2019s stand back and consider that the passage presents a view of marriage that may be challenging to our very filters. Because the biblical model of marriage is neither optimistic nor pessimistic about human nature, and it\u2019s neither traditional nor modern.\nLet\u2019s look at it. The model of marriage in this passage has three things to it: 1) a power, 2) a purpose, and 3) a pointer.\u00a0\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 16, 1998. Series: Ephesians \u2013 God\u2019s New Society. Scripture: Ephesians 5:21-33.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

We think, \u201ceverybody gets impatient!\u201d\u00a0\nBut in James 5, it says impatience and grumbling is worthy of judgment. You may say, \u201cWhy?\u201d But what do you think murder is? It\u2019s just grumbles that were planted and watered and fertilized. Impatience is at the root of things.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s look at 1) the danger of impatience 2) what patience is, 3) what patience is not, 4) the counterfeit of patience, and 5) how you develop a patient heart.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 25, 1990.

Right when you\u2019ve decided to storm the stronghold of the enemy.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re looking at the armor of God\u2014it\u2019s an illustration Paul uses as a way of saying we have everything we need to meet the battles of life, but we must make use of those resources. And in looking at the shield of faith, we see that the more we decide to get our lives together, the more likely we are to find fiery arrows coming at us.\nThis passage on the shield of faith teaches us: 1) God lets Satan send us fiery trials, 2) we should expect fiery trials, and 3) faith is not a passive thing.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 29, 1992. Series: Spiritual Warfare \u2013 The Armor of God.

But there\u2019s another sense in which you don\u2019t.\u00a0\nYou\u2019ve received the armor when you became a Christian, but then the process of growing in grace is actually a process of sticking each piece on, piece by piece.\nWe\u2019re continuing our look at the armor of God by looking at 1) what it means to put on the belt of truth, and then, 2) what it means to understand the breastplate of righteousness.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 2, 1992. Series: Spiritual Warfare \u2013 The Armor of God.

                "summary": "In order to be wise, we have to learn how to understand and manage the power of sexuality.\u00a0\nWisdom is not less than being moral and good, but it\u2019s quite a bit more. It\u2019s knowing the right decision to make in the vast majority of life situations that the moral rules don\u2019t address.\nIf we\u2019re going to be wise with regard to sex, we have to know three things: 1) why and how we tend to undervalue sex, 2) why and how we tend, at the same time, to overvalue sex, and 3) how we can solve that.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 24, 2004. Series: Proverbs: True Wisdom for Living. Scripture: Proverbs 5:15-19; 11:16, 22; 30:18-20.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
