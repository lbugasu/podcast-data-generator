Because it\u2019s a perfect overview of the emotional life that the life of faith brings.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re going to weep. In this world, you will weep. But how are you weeping? What are you doing with your sorrows? They need to be sown. They need to be invested. They need to be planted, in a sense, or they need to water.</p>\n<p>Psalm 126 tells us 3 things about how we\u2019re supposed to address our sorrows: 1) it tells us to expect weeping, 2) it tells us to expect new kinds of tears, and 3) it tells us to sow our tears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But let me say there are three principles: 1) the life of faith is a life of both rejoicing and weeping, 2) the life of faith is a life of greater rejoicing and greater weeping, and 3) the life of faith is a life of interdependent rejoicing and weeping.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on July 13, 1997.

That\u2019s how you change.\u00a0\nBut the modern mind finds some of these disciplines more appetizing than others. The idea of meditation is sort of cool. But obedience? That\u2019s not very appetizing. And yet, this discipline tells us that you don\u2019t get changed unless you\u2019re willing to come in under the authority of God.\nLet\u2019s look at what Psalm 119 shows us about 1) what\u2019s wrong with trying to be your own ultimate spiritual authority, and 2) how you can put yourself under God\u2019s authority in a way that\u2019s transforming and not stifling.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 14, 2002.

He\u2019s ready to give a second chance.\u00a0\nIn Genesis 9, God says to Noah and his family the same thing he said to Adam and Eve. In some ways, it gives more detail into what kind of life we\u2019re called into. In a sense, he\u2019s saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not really living a fully human life unless you maintain three great relationships.\u201d\nHe\u2019s calling us into 1) a relationship with the earth, which brings up the issue of ecology, 2) a relationship with all the people of the earth, which brings up the issue of justice, and 3) a relationship with the Lord of the earth, which brings up the issue of grace.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 10, 2000. Series: Genesis \u2013 The Gospel According to God. Scripture: Genesis 9:1-17.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

It\u2019s both rich and famous.\nBecause it\u2019s so rich, you could work through it word by word and get quite a bit out of it. But it\u2019s also advantageous to do what we\u2019re going to do, which is to fly over the whole thing. In this way, we\u2019ll get a panoramic view of the immense biblical wisdom on this subject of marriage.\nWhat we learn about marriage here is 1) what it is, 2) what it does, 3) what it needs, and 4) what it shows.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 15, 2012.

But in all my years as a minister, I\u2019ve seldom talked to anybody who rejected Christianity and actually knew what they rejected.\nIf you\u2019re uninterested in Christianity, you need to know what it is you\u2019re rejecting. And if you are a Christian, you need to figure out if you\u2019re living consistently. In these first verses of Ephesians, Paul gives an amazing picture of what it means to be a Christian.\nThis passage shows us that being a Christian means three things: 1) truth, 2) hope, and 3) glory.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 16, 2011. Series: A Study of Ephesians: Who is the Church?

The answer is a divided heart.\nTo put it another way, Jonah believed in and served the true God, but he also believed and served a rival god. As a result, his heart was divided. And divided hearts create the kind of misery and drive we see in Jonah. So we must ask, is it possible that our own instabilities are due to a divided heart?\nLet\u2019s ask two questions of this text: 1) what is a divided heart? and 2) how do we solve it?\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 2, 1990.

But what does it mean?\nBefore Christ came, the cross was a gallows, a firing squad, a guillotine. All the cross meant was that you\u2019d lost. It was not a symbol of strength\u2014it was a symbol of weakness.\nGalatians 3 is perhaps the most complete picture on the meaning of the cross. Let\u2019s look at 1) why the cross is necessary, 2) what actually happened on the cross, and 3) how the cross makes us different.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 18, 1998. Series: Galatians: New Freedom, New Family. Scripture: Galatians 3:10-14.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
