In absolute contrast, you have Jesus, who dies at age 33, ignominiously, in agony, abandoned by everyone. But on the night before he died, Jesus gave his disciples the interpretation, the meaning of his death on the cross, and when it was all over, it changed them and the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jesus tells us four life-changing principles about his death: 1) Jesus\u2019 death is the center of history, 2) Jesus\u2019 death is the foundation for a radically new, profoundly different community, 3) Jesus\u2019 death is the solution to the great mystery, and 4) Jesus\u2019 death is appropriated personally.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 6, 2003.

It\u2019s like the song in the Live Aid concert in 1985, \u201cWe Are the World.\u201d That\u2019s what most people think the meaning of Christmas is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But after that 1985 concert, Bob Dylan said to the press that he was uncomfortable singing a song like that. They asked him why. He said, \u201cBecause man cannot save himself.\u201d So we look today unto Bob Dylan for the true meaning of Christmas\u2014because he got it right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Bible says Jesus Christ came because we cannot save ourselves. Colossians 1 shows us 1) the need for reconciliation, 2) the way of reconciliation, and 3) the radical, thorough results of reconciliation.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 24, 1995.

But Jesus says his message is absolutely different. Everyone who really becomes a Christian has a sense of being awakened. Something radical has to happen. A real Christian is someone who has been called. A real Christian is someone who has had an experience like Matthew.\nThe calling of Matthew shows us that to be called means 1) you sense a power coming in from outside taking charge, 2) you are confronted with a person, not a lot of intellectual ideas, and 3) you rise and follow him.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 10, 1995.

                "summary": "It\u2019s not the whale events in your life that make you who you are. It\u2019s all the guppies. Every morning you wake up and millions of them come at you. You have to eat. You have to sleep. You have appointments. The mundane, the hum-drum, the hustle and bustle.\u00a0\nThe difference between Martha and Mary is that Martha is swept along by the mundane, but Mary has put her feet at the bottom of the stream. The stream is going one way, but Mary walks the direction she wants to walk. Mary sits at Jesus\u2019 feet in spite of distractions, in spite of opposition.\u00a0\nBecause we\u2019re more like Martha than Mary, we\u2019re sinking in a sea of mediocrity. So we ask, what does it mean to sit at Jesus\u2019 feet? Let\u2019s look at: 1) who Martha is, 2) what Martha needs, 3) what Mary does, and 4) why we should do like Mary.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 9, 1997.

He sticks them together, even though on the surface, they look utterly different.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the wedding feast, you have Jesus acting quietly, hidden, privately. Here in the cleansing of the temple, you have him public and dramatic. There, he was requested. He was asked in. Here, he goes where no one has asked him to go. He intrudes. He intervenes. At the wedding, he brings joy and laughter. Here, he brings weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Jesus Christ comes into your life, he will sometimes fill your table with a feast and other times, he will turn your table over and spill everything on the ground. These passages show us the authority of who he is, they show us the purpose of what he does, and then they show us the glory of what he brings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 24, 1996.

He sticks them together, even though on the surface, they look utterly different.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the wedding feast, you have Jesus acting quietly, hidden, privately. Here in the cleansing of the temple, you have him public and dramatic. There, he was requested. He was asked in. Here, he goes where no one has asked him to go. He intrudes. He intervenes. At the wedding, he brings joy and laughter. Here, he brings weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Jesus Christ comes into your life, he will sometimes fill your table with a feast and other times, he will turn your table over and spill everything on the ground.

And on the night before Jesus is about to die, he\u2019s talking about the Holy Spirit.\u00a0\nWhy is Jesus so constantly talking about the Holy Spirit? I think we see at least two reasons. One is a hard reason, at least it\u2019s hard to hear. And one is a wonderful reason.\u00a0\nI think the two reasons that Jesus thinks the Holy Spirit is so important to talk about, so crucial to understand, so important to have, is because 1) without the Holy Spirit there\u2019s no remedy for our spiritual blindness and cluelessness, but 2) with the Holy Spirit, we can be taken into realms of experience and transformation that we can\u2019t imagine.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 26, 2017.

We\u2019re looking now to, I think, probably the strangest of all narrative accounts in the Bible of a human being encountering God.\nIt\u2019s a long story. All of Jacob\u2019s life, he\u2019s been wrestling with his twin brother, Esau. He\u2019s been away, but he decides to come back and finally have it out. He sends a bunch of gifts ahead of him, he divides his own family up, and he gets ready to meet Esau alone. And there in the dark when Jacob is alone, a mysterious man\u2014not Esau\u2014attacks him, and he wrestles him all night. Finally, as the day is about to break, Jacob realizes this is the Lord himself\u2014that he\u2019s wrestling with God.\nJacob meets God, and the encounter tells us how we can meet God and how we can check our own hearts to find out if we\u2019ve met God. Four things: 1) an encounter with God is personal, 2) an encounter with God is personal wrestling, 3) an encounter with God is always losing, but 4) an encounter with God is winning through losing.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 21, 1997. Series: Pointers to Christ \u2013 Directional Signs in History. Scripture: Genesis 32:22-32.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

Can we find a way through them?\nI\u2019d like to give you something to consider as a possible way through: it\u2019s important to see 1) that people\u2019s problems with religion are themselves beliefs which in turn have their own problems, and 2) that Christianity has a unique resource for each of these problems.\nThis talk was given by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 9, 2003.
