And the claim that was most revolting to that society is also what our society sees as the most repugnant: the shocking claim that salvation is found in no one else.\nIt\u2019s critical to realize this claim was as implausible in the Greco-Roman world as it is in ours. The Roman Empire was every bit as religiously pluralistic as our society, if not more. If they were as revolted as we were, why did so many believe it?\u00a0\nActs 4 shows us four important things: 1) the claim was an implication, not arrogation, 2) the claim is no more exclusive than the claim of religious relativism, 3) this exclusive claim led to a transformation of identity, and 4) this exclusive claim led to the most inclusive human community the world had ever seen.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 26, 2003.

And of all the things I\u2019ve read, none of them are as nuanced as what Jesus says.\nJesus says one of the main resources his disciples need in life is joy. And he says joy is something he gives. In John 15:11, he says, \u201cI give you my joy that your joy may be complete,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t elaborate on it. In John 16, he gives us more information.\u00a0\nWhat does John 16 tell us about the joy that Jesus gives? Five things: that this joy 1) is inevitable, 2) is not circumstantial, 3) is thoughtful, 4) is prayerful, and 5) is based on wonder.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 2, 2017. Series: Jesus, Mission, and Glory: New Power.
