That\u2019s one reason we need the book of Jonah.\nJonah gives a concept of sin that can\u2019t be used to oppress people. In fact, it shows that it\u2019s one thing to believe in sin and another thing to understand it in your own heart. Jonah was a prophet, but there was a kind of sin in his heart that flew under his radar\u2014until it blew up.\nLet\u2019s look at four features in the narrative that each tell us something about sin: 1) the coming word, 2) the running man, 3) the deathly sleep, and 4) the stormy hope.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 9, 2001. Series: The Church in the City. Scripture: Jonah 1:1-10.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

And the book of Jonah is all about Jonah running and God pursuing.</p>\n<p>Most of us are familiar with the words sin and grace, but what they mean is another thing. And here it is: essentially sin is running away from God, and grace is God\u2019s effort to pursue and intercept self-destructive behavior. That\u2019s it. Running and chasing. And the first step in any relationship with God is to admit you\u2019ve run and that even now, to some degree, you\u2019re running.</p>\n<p>So let\u2019s look now at how 1) Jonah is called to do something, 2) Jonah runs away from it, and 3) God pursues him.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on July 22, 1990.

Now, how does it actually work?\nLet\u2019s look at 1) the signs of spiritual deadness, 2) the signs of spiritual life, and 3) how you move over from death to life.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 12, 1998.

But at the very same moment, there\u2019s another part of that legal transaction: something is put on me. I\u2019m adopted as God\u2019s own son.\nGalatians tells us that because we\u2019re legally adopted, we have an agent\u2014it\u2019s the Spirit. The Spirit is sent not into the world but into our hearts. And the Spirit comes to give not the objective status, which we already have, but the subjective experience of sonship.\nLet\u2019s break it into three things: 1) what is promised, 2) what it\u2019s like, and 3) how it comes.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 8, 1998. Series: Galatians: New Freedom, New Family.

Life seems unjust. Asaph\u2019s just about to chuck his faith. Yet at the end, he\u2019s able to say in his pain, \u201cGod is always good.\u201d\u00a0\nI\u2019ll tell you, if you\u2019re trying to live a decent life, this is going to happen to you. At some point, you\u2019re going to say, \u201cGod, why are you letting this happen? You\u2019re not running my life right. You\u2019re not running history right.\u201d It\u2019s going to happen. How will you handle it?\u00a0\nHow does Asaph do it? He goes through a number of steps: 1) he grabbed hold of a negative, 2) he entered the sanctuary for understanding, 3) he saw the big picture, and 4) he asked the ultimate question.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 28, 1993.

So how do you deal with a guilty conscience?\u00a0\nIn Psalm 51, David has been plunged\u2014through the shock of recognizing the magnitude of evil he\u2019s done\u2014into the depths. Imagine the guilt, the shame, the horror, the self-hatred. He\u2019s plunged into an emotional and spiritual dungeon. And yet this psalm is a record of his rescue. There\u2019s no good human explanation for how he got out. But he got out.\nHere\u2019s how he did it: he made two critical distinctions. He learned 1) the distinction between remorse and real repentance, and 2) the distinction between a reprieve and regeneration.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 31, 1993.

Foolishness is a function of how you use your intelligence.\u00a0\nThe Bible says every human being is born with a heavy streak of foolishness. It\u2019s like a deposit. It\u2019s foolishness, according to the Bible, that destroys our sense of God\u2019s reality. And it\u2019s a common reason why people have trouble believing God is real.\nThe Bible tells us 1) foolishness is a proud willfulness that keeps us from learning, 2) foolishness is a superficiality that makes it impossible to see our own heart commitments as alternatives to believing in God, and 3) foolishness can\u2019t understand grace.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 3, 1993.

And the claim that was most revolting to that society is also what our society sees as the most repugnant: the shocking claim that salvation is found in no one else.\nIt\u2019s critical to realize this claim was as implausible in the Greco-Roman world as it is in ours. The Roman Empire was every bit as religiously pluralistic as our society, if not more. If they were as revolted as we were, why did so many believe it?\u00a0\nActs 4 shows us four important things: 1) the claim was an implication, not arrogation, 2) the claim is no more exclusive than the claim of religious relativism, 3) this exclusive claim led to a transformation of identity, and 4) this exclusive claim led to the most inclusive human community the world had ever seen.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 26, 2003. Series: The Necessity of Belief. Scripture: Acts 4:8-14, 31-37.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

Of course, that immediately raises the question, why wouldn\u2019t we feel at home here?\u00a0\nThe prophet Jeremiah gives us a lot of insight: 1) why we long for a home, 2) how we can get home, and 3) what life there will be like.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 28, 2003.
