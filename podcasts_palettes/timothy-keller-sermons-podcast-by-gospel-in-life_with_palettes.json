                "summary": "In public these days, Christmas is seen as meaning that if we work hard, if we hold hands and breathe in unison, if we get together, we can make the world a better place. It\u2019s like the song in the Live Aid concert in 1985, \u201cWe Are the World.\u201d That\u2019s what most people think the meaning of Christmas is.\u00a0\nBut after that 1985 concert, Bob Dylan said to the press that he was uncomfortable singing a song like that. They asked him why. He said, \u201cBecause man cannot save himself.\u201d So we look today unto Bob Dylan for the true meaning of Christmas\u2014because he got it right.\u00a0\nThe Bible says Jesus Christ came because we cannot save ourselves. Colossians 1 shows us 1) the need for reconciliation, 2) the way of reconciliation, and 3) the radical, thorough results of reconciliation.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 24, 1995. Series: Advent: God and Sinners Reconciled. Scripture: Colossians 1:19-23.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

                "summary": "In John 2, John puts the changing of water into wine at the wedding and the cleansing of the temple together. He sticks them together, even though on the surface, they look utterly different.\u00a0\nIn the wedding feast, you have Jesus acting quietly, hidden, privately. Here in the cleansing of the temple, you have him public and dramatic. There, he was requested. He was asked in. Here, he goes where no one has asked him to go. He intrudes. He intervenes. At the wedding, he brings joy and laughter. Here, he brings weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u00a0\nIf Jesus Christ comes into your life, he will sometimes fill your table with a feast and other times, he will turn your table over and spill everything on the ground. These passages show us the authority of who he is, they show us the purpose of what he does, and then they show us the glory of what he brings.\u00a0\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 24, 1996. Series: The Real Jesus Part 2; His Life.

But we don\u2019t\u2014not really.\u00a0\nIf we don\u2019t understand sin, then Christianity makes no sense. But even more so, if we don\u2019t understand sin, then the knowledge of God\u2019s love and grace won\u2019t really transform or heal us. So how do we find out what the Bible means by sin? By looking at Jonah, who\u2019s said to be very religious, and seeing how he falls into terrible sin, we can then get a good idea of what sin is.\u00a0\nIn the story of Jonah, we see him doing four things. And each one of them tells us something about the real nature of sin. We see Jonah 1) running, 2) sleeping, 3) sinking, and 4) rising.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 26, 1997. Series: Pointers to Christ \u2013 Directional Signs in History. Scripture: Jonah 1:1-5, 2:1-10.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

It\u2019s an incredibly old woman we have here: a woman who\u2019s 90 years old. We\u2019re told in the Bible that this laughter is a clue to who God is and what he has done and how you find him.\u00a0\nThis passage is actually the key, because all of Abraham and Sarah\u2019s lives and all of their fascinating incidents can be understood in terms of the name of their son. The name \u201cIsaac\u201d means laughter. You can understand all of their lives, and actually I think eventually you\u2019ll be able to understand all of your life, through the word \u201claughter.\u201d\u00a0\nThere\u2019ve been three kinds of laughter in the story of Abraham and Sarah. They had to go through the first two to get to the third. Let\u2019s look at these three kinds of laughter: 1) the laughter of scoffing, 2) the wild laughter of addiction and fixation, and 3) the laughter of grace.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 14, 1997.

Rather, biblically, marriage is friendship garnished with romance.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re going to marry somebody, you should marry someone who is now or has the potential to be your very best friend. But friendship is not just a feeling of affection. Friendship is a particular form of love, and it has a structure.\u00a0\nThe structure of friendship is a deep oneness that comes from two people journeying together toward a common horizon. Let\u2019s look now at 1) the common horizon, 2) how you get to that horizon, and 3) the implications of journeying together toward that horizon.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 15, 1991.

You can put it in a phrase: we\u2019re justified by faith through the blood of Christ.\u00a0\nWe look now at one of those terms: faith. What is this saving faith that connects us to God? Notice that Paul twice contrasts faith with boasting. He tries to throw into relief what saving faith is by contrasting it with this idea of boasting.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s look at this passage under three headings: 1) the spiritual sickness the Bible calls boasting, 2) the antidote to that spiritual sickness, and 3) what it means to take the antidote.\nThis sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 22, 2009.
