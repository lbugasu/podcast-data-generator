Subscribe now so you don't miss it!\n\nAbout The Show:\n\nOn March 31, 1995, nine-year-old Maria Garcia came home to find her mother glued to the TV, tears rolling down her rosy cheeks. The phone kept ringing. Relatives in Mexico and the States wanted to know if Maria\u2019s family was watching, too. American networks and Mexican programming aired the same top story. Selena Quintanilla, the Grammy-winning ascending Mexican American popstar had been killed \u2014 swiftly, violently \u2014 by the president of her fan club.\n\nThe story shook the country and changed Maria\u2019s life.\n\nIn \"Anything For Selena,\" host Maria Garcia goes on an intimate, revelatory quest to understand how Selena has become a potent symbol for tensions around race, class and body politics in the United States.\n\nThe series weaves Maria\u2019s personal story as a queer, first-generation Mexican immigrant with cultural analysis, history and politics to explore how, 25 years after her death, Selena remains an unparalleled vessel for understanding Latino identity and American belonging.",
