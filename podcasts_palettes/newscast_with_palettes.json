Today, we look at BP\u2019s decision to pause all Red Sea shipments after rebel attacks. \n \nThe firm blamed the \"deteriorating security situation\" in the region as Iran-backed Houthis target ships they believe are bound for Israel. Adam speaks to Diplomatic correspondent James Landale and John Stawpert from the International Chamber of Shipping to find out what it means and how it could affect prices here.\n \nAnd, the government has announced a package of more than \u00a364bn, but will this be enough to stop more councils from going bust? Adam looks at the issues faced by town halls with leader of Buckinghamshire County Council, Martin Tett, and Stuart Hoddinott from the Institute for Government.\n \nYou can join our Newscast online community here: https://tinyurl.com/newscastcommunityhere\n \nToday's Newscast was presented by Adam Fleming.
