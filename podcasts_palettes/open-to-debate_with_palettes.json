                    "itunes:summary": "Prostitution remains heavily stigmatized and legally complex globally, ranging from full decriminalization to controlled regulation like the Nordic Model, where only purchasers of sex, not sellers of sex are penalized. This model has been implemented in eight countries, including Sweden, Iceland, Canada, and France, as well as in the U.S. state of Maine. Those who argue that it is ok to pay for sex say that it\u2019s a profession that deserves as much respect as any other and that those who do it for a living have a right to do with their bodies as they please.\u00a0They also argue that decriminalizing the profession is the only method to reduce violence against sex workers. Those who say that it is not ok to pay for sex and support the Nordic model are concerned about inequities present between sex buyers and sex workers that are rooted in oppression and power imbalances, as some sex workers choose the profession under\u00a0economic or social duress. They are also concerned about exploitation and coercion, which can sometimes open the door to human trafficking.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nWith this background, we debate the following question: Is It OK to Pay for Sex?\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nArguing Yes:\u00a0Kaytlin Bailey, Sex Workers Rights Advocate; Founder & Executive Director of Old Pros and Host of \u201cThe Oldest Profession Podcast\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nArguing No: Yasmin Vafa, Human Rights Attorney;\u00a0Co-Founder and Executive Director at Rights4Girls\u00a0\n\nEmmy award-winning journalist\u00a0John Donvan\u00a0moderates\u00a0\nLearn more about your ad choices.

This wage gap has persisted despite near-record rates of women\u2019s participation in the labor market, with wage gaps even larger for women in minority populations, and it\u2019s estimated that pay parity will not be achieved until 2052. Should policy interventions address these disparities, or is it more important to recognize and honor women's personal decisions and find another way to look at the gap Those in favor of fixing the gap see it as a point of fairness and equity that would bring economic benefits, such as enhanced family incomes and increased productivity, and say that new policies are needed urgently to dismantle systemic barriers stopping women from earning more. Those who aren\u2019t in favor argue wage disparities reflect individual choices regarding career paths, work-life balance, and tenure, rather than systemic discrimination. They also point out that when adjusted for factors like job type, hours worked, and career breaks, the gap significantly narrows.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAgainst this backdrop, we debate the question: Should We Address the Gender Wage Gap?\u00a0\n\nArguing Yes:\u00a0Kadie Ward,\u00a0Commissioner\u00a0and Chief Administrative Officer of the\u00a0Pay Equity Commission of Ontario\u00a0\nArguing No:\u00a0\u00a0Allison Schrager,\u00a0Pension Economist, Bloomberg Opinion Contributor & Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNayeema\u00a0Raza, Journalist at New York Magazine and Vox, is the guest moderator.\u00a0\nLearn more about your ad choices.

It is the most downloaded app since 2021. And like virtually all of social media, user privacy concerns abound. But TikTok adds an extra layer. Owned by Chinese company\u00a0ByteDance, there are worries that U.S. data could be transmitted to China\u2019s government, despite assurances from the company that it is not.

                    "itunes:summary": "With the wealth gap widening, some Americans are starting to consider socialism as a viable economic and political model. Supporters of capitalism claim that no other system has been as effective in creating value, increasing prosperity, and producing the wealth that has lifted billions of people out of poverty. The free market, they argue, encourages competition and human ingenuity, values individual choice, and organizes society in a fair and just way. Critics of capitalism, however, paint a different picture. They argue that capitalism is inherently exploitative and that business owners seek profits above all else, leading to the distortion of human worth as one distilled to an individual\u2019s labor power. Further, they claim that a capitalist system is inherently rigged to benefit the wealthy and powerful, and the byproducts of which have created unsustainable waste and decimated the world\u2019s wildlife and natural resources. In light of this emerging divide, we ask this question: Is capitalism a blessing?\nWith John Mackey, Bhaskar Sunkara, Katherine Mangu-Ward, and Richard D.

After decades of decline, workers are organizing at well-known companies, like Starbucks, Amazon, and Google, at a pace not seen since the 1930s. Decades of stagnant wages, recent labor shortages, and the most vocally pro-union President in recent memory have all stoked key wins for American labor, including successful strikes at John Deere and Kellogg. In fact, recent polling shows public support for labor unions has climbed to 71%, its highest level since 1965. During the old industrial days, unions had broad influence over the American economy. But their power waned. In 1983, one in 5 employees belonged to a union. Last year, that number had dwindled to one in 10, with most of the declines occurring in the private sector. Some say good riddance. They argue that unions actually hurt workers and the economy under the guise of supporting both. Union dues sap salaries, they say, and can actually increase unemployment. They also make the economy more rigid to change, raise consumer prices, and ultimately render unionized companies less competitive. Advocates, however, argue that in light of yawning income inequality, organized labor is desperately needed. Unions increase workers\u2019 pay and benefits, they say, and can also settle disputes more equitably, improve wages, and encourage a more robust middle class. Of course, not all unions are created equal. And the difference between private and public-sector unions needs to be explored. Yet as public support for organized labor has grown as more workers push to join unions, an overarching question looms large: Do Unions Work For The Economy?\u00a0\nLearn more about your ad choices.

While the term \"cancelling\" has roots in a misogynistic joke, it has come to be one of the most prominent tools of progressive activists.

These nations \u2013 along with a coalition of scholars, activists, and nonprofit organizations \u2013 argue that developing nations are at risk of waiting years to get full access to the vaccines unless these protections are lifted. But their opponents say suspending patent protections will do little to speed up the manufacturing process. Instead, undermining these protections will ensure that the next time the world needs an emergency vaccine, governments and pharmaceuticals will be unable to act as swiftly. It\u2019s a debate emblematic of the uneven vaccine rollout, and strikes at the core of society\u2019s ability to act quickly.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode of Agree to Disagree, John Donvan sits with Thomas Cueni, director-general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations and Brook Baker, law professor at Northeastern University and senior policy analyst at Health GAP, to debate the future of vaccine patents.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Under these regulations, internet service providers (ISPs) such as Verizon, Comcast and AT&T, the corporate giants who deliver the internet into our homes, could supply web infrastructure, but could not preference how data passed through it.\u00a0Denying them that power, supporters argue, remains critical to ensuring that users and content-creators can discover ideas and information without censorship, or charges, from these prospective gatekeepers.\u00a0After all, no person should have to pay for every video streamed on YouTube; no startup should be hobbled against established companies who buy faster access to consumers; and no minority voice should have its ideas throttled by wealthier interests.\nOn the other hand, net neutrality opponents argue that the genius of the Internet has been its individually driven, organic development, free from the heavy hand of so-called net neutrality.\u00a0These burdensome regulations constitute dangerous governmental overreach, stifle innovation, and spike costs for both consumers and providers.\u00a0The result, they maintain, will be a less interesting, less democratic, less innovative web.\u00a0Moreover, Americans will enjoy uninterrupted access to their favorite sites \u2013 without net neutrality \u2013 because ISPs make more money from an open, rather than closed, internet.\u00a0Consequently, the backlash against the FCC\u2019s decision is overblown, and ending net neutrality is the right policy for the future of America\u2019s internet.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
