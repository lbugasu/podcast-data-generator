The big &#8216;turning point,&#8217; if there is one, tends to come late in the story. In the interim, make use of anything as a trigger. Don&#8217;t wait for a catalyst. What you make of events is more important than the events themselves. Take advantage of whatever life sends your way to revise, or at least reconsider, your story.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Life-Transitions-Mastering-Change-Any/dp/1594206821/\"><strong>Book</strong>:<em> Life Is in the Transitions: Mastering Change at Any Age</em></a> by Bruce Feiler &#8212; &#8220;Each of us carries around an unspoken set of assumptions that dictate how we expect our lives will unfold. These expectations come from all corners and influence us more than we admit. We&#8217;ve been led to believe that our lives will always ascend, for example, and are shocked to discover they oscillate instead. Our society tells us we should be basking in progress, but our experience tells us we are beset by slip-ups. Might this gap help explain the anxiety so many of us feel?&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/07/disrupt-yourself-3\"><strong>HBR:&#160;</strong>Disrupt Yourself</a>&#160;by Whitney Johnson &#8212; &#8220;Current stakeholders in your life and career will probably encourage you to avoid disruption. For many of us, though, holding steady really means slipping&#8212;as we ignore the threat of competition from younger, more agile innovators, bypass opportunities for greater reward, and sacrifice personal growth.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2010/01/managing-yourself-five-ways-to-bungle-a-job-change\"><strong>HBR</strong>: Managing Yourself: Five Ways to Bungle a Job Change</a>&#160;by Boris Groysberg and Robin Abrahams &#8212; &#8220;People who switch organizations&#8212;whether they&#8217;re wide receivers changing football teams or general managers going to new companies&#8212;all face similar problems. It&#8217;s not just about the learning curve. Moves of all kinds entail significant internal and external challenges and transaction costs: upheaval in your home and social life; potential relocation expenses; adjustments to new cultural and political norms; navigation of unclear expectations; and the need to learn a new canon, skill set, and jargon.&#8221;</p>\n",

Personal technology and digital connectivity had advanced so far and so fast that people had begun to ask, &#8216;Do we really need to be together, in an office, to do our work?&#8217; We got our answer during the pandemic lockdowns. We learned that a great many of us don&#8217;t in fact need to be colocated with colleagues on-site to do our jobs. Individuals, teams, entire workforces, can perform well while being entirely distributed&#8212;and they have.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Time-Smart-Reclaim-Your-Happier/dp/1633698351/\"><strong>Book</strong>: <em>Time Smart: How to Reclaim Your Time and Live a Happier Life</em></a> by Ashley Whillans &#8212; &#8220;It&#8217;s not our fault we&#8217;ve ended up like this. Culturally, the inherent value of time has been suppressed. Society teaches us that we should hero-worship people who never leave the office. Moreover, rising income inequality makes us feel as if our world could collapse tomorrow if we don&#8217;t spend every moment working, or at least appearing to work. These factors create what I call <strong>time traps</strong>, which lead most of us to feel chronically time-poor.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/05/reclaim-your-commute\"><strong>HBR</strong>: Reclaim Your Commute</a> by Francesca Gino, Bradley Staats, Jon M.

In a&#160;recent study&#160;of more than twenty-four hundred employees in Denmark, Jan Pejtersen and his colleagues found that as the number of people working in a single room went up, the number of employees who took sick leave increased apace.

This is fine when you&#8217;re clarifying action steps for a project you&#8217;re leading or when people come to you asking for advice. But in a coaching conversation, it&#8217;s essential to restrain your impulse to provide the answers. Your path is not your employee&#8217;s path. Open-ended questions, not answers, are the tools of coaching. You succeed as a coach by helping your team members articulate their goals and challenges and find their own answers.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Helping-People-Change-Coaching-Compassion/dp/1633696561/\"><strong>Book</strong>:&#160;<em>Helping People Change: Coaching with Compassion for Lifelong Learning and Growth</em></a>&#160;by Richard E.

But at least they will be heading in the right direction, under their own steam. And in the end, you ideally will have not only a rehabilitated employee but also a healthier, more productive organization.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/11/how-to-manage-a-stubborn-defensive-or-defiant-employee\"><strong>HBR</strong>: How to Manage a Stubborn, Defensive, or Defiant Employee</a> by Liz Kislik &#8212; &#8220;Some of the hardest employees to manage are people who are consistently oppositional. They might actively debate or ignore feedback, refuse to follow instructions they disagree with, or create a constant stream of negative comments about new initiatives. Most often, these behaviors are meant to make the employee look strong and mask a fear of change, an aversion to anticipated conflict, or the worry that they will look stupid or incompetent.&#8221;</p>\n",

It&#8217;s not confidence itself that produces success; it&#8217;s the investment and the effort. Without enough confidence, it&#8217;s too easy to give up prematurely or not get started at all.

But being out of the office means cramming in extra work up until you leave &#8212; and making up for lost time once you return.

Be prepared to answer the question of why you need to be there in a non-self-serving way.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffschmitt/2013/01/15/8-ways-to-rebound-from-a-demotion/\"><strong>Forbes:</strong> 8 Ways To Rebound From A Demotion</a> by Jeff Schmitt &#8212; &#8220;It may be hard to accept, but a demotion is temporary. You&#8217;ll overcome it, accept it, or leave because of it. So keep your resentment in check. And do what every athlete does: Find a way to motivate yourself each day. Most important, don&#8217;t try forcing the action. Focus on your role, strengths, and teammates and the game will eventually flow back through you.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/11/how-to-keep-working-when-youre-just-not-feeling-it\"><strong>HBR:</strong> How to Keep Working When You&#8217;re Just Not Feeling It by Ayelet Fishbach</a> &#8212; &#8220;In cases where that&#8217;s impractical&#8212;we don&#8217;t all find jobs and get assignments we love&#8212;the trick is to focus on the elements of the work that you do find enjoyable.

It&#8217;s not something that&#160;<em>happens</em>&#160;to a company. It&#8217;s an act by its leadership when no other&#160;routes can be pursued.

If a company founder has three children, each of whom marries and produces three more children, each of whom marries, within three generations there could be 25 people or more (including all the spouses) working or looking to work at the company.

In some cases, open-plan office designs are&#160;reported to increase collaboration, employee satisfaction, and communication, but in others these new spaces are criticized for&#160;creating distractions, reducing privacy and autonomy, and undermining employee motivation and satisfaction.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap\"><strong>The New Yorker</strong>: The Open-Office Trap</a> by Maria Konnikova &#8212; &#8220;An open environment may even have a negative impact on our health. In a&#160;recent study&#160;of more than twenty-four hundred employees in Denmark, Jan Pejtersen and his colleagues found that as the number of people working in a single room went up, the number of employees who took sick leave increased apace. Workers in two-person offices took an average of fifty per cent more sick leave than those in single offices, while those who worked in fully open offices were out an average of sixty-two per cent more.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/05/7-factors-of-great-office-design\"><strong>HBR</strong>: 7 Factors of Great Office Design</a> by Peter Bacevice, Liz Burow, and Mat Triebner &#8212; &#8220;The design and outfitting of workspace is a major capital investment for any organization that can affect a number of business outcomes, including productivity, employee satisfaction, engagement, talent recruitment, and brand impact. Given the myriad ways to design and plan a space, leaders should approach workplace design in a strategic way. Imitating the latest fads start-ups are adopting won&#8217;t necessarily get you the results your company desires; asking the right questions &#8212; and, above all, listening to employees&#8217; answers &#8212; will.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/03/why-you-should-rotate-office-seating-assignments\"><strong>HBR</strong>: Why You Should Rotate Office Seating Assignments</a> &#8212; &#8220;Interestingly, the change to employees&#8217; physical space seemed to boost performance even more than did another switch the company made (which Lee also studied), from individual incentives to fixed wages.

Hill &#8212; &#8220;After a few painful experiences, new managers come to the unsettling realization that the source of their power is, according to one, &#8216;everything but&#8217; formal authority.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>HBR:</b> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-authenticity-paradox\">The Authenticity Paradox</a> by Herminia Ibarra &#8212; &#8220;The only way we grow as leaders is by stretching the limits of who we are&#8212;doing new things that make us uncomfortable but that teach us through direct experience who we want to become. Such growth doesn&#8217;t require a radical personality makeover.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>HBR:</b> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/07/connect-then-lead\">Connect, Then Lead</a>&#160;by Amy J.C. Cuddy, Matthew Kohut, and John Neffinger&#8212; &#8220;The strategies we suggest may seem awkward at first, but they will soon create a positive feedback loop. Being calm and confident creates space to be warm, open, and appreciative, to choose to act in ways that reflect and express your values and priorities.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>HBR:</b> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/12/what-if-you-dont-want-to-be-a\">What If You Don&#8217;t Want to Be a Manager?</a> by Anne Kreamer &#8212; &#8220;When I made my leap, I discovered that while there are countless books and courses about how to be a better manager, there are pretty much no roadmaps for how to keep succeeding if you decide you don&#8217;t want to manage others.&#8221;</p>\n",
