    "description": "\n      <p>A luxury hotel pool attendant in Miami meets a married couple. The wife starts flirting with the young man...and pretty soon he is caught up in a love triangle, one that will have far-reaching results. The husband is Jerry Falwell Jr., member of one of the most famous evangelical families in America and president of a Christian university with a strict code of conduct. The affair is part of a pattern of questionable behavior that will threaten the Falwell family dynasty. From Wondery, the makers of The Shrink Next Door and Bunga Bunga, comes IN GOD WE LUST, a six part series about what the tabloids called \u201cthe pool boy\u201d scandal. Co-hosted by Brooke Siffrinn and Aricia Skidmore-Williams, the duo brings their humor and distinctive style of their hit series EVEN THE RICH to a reported miniseries for the very first time.</p>\n    ",
