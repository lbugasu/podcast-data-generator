(Interesting fact: his second cousin was the first African-American undergraduate student at the same university.) Adam is a member of the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors and has already earned an impressive collection of professional awards: 2016 Career Life Success Award; 2016 Career Life Producer Award; 2017 Agency Builder of The Year, Greater Atlanta; and Executive Council Member in 2017-2020 and MDRT Member 2021. \n\nAdam brings the same passion and energy to community leadership roles as he displays in his professional pursuits, serving as Chair of Atlanta Smart Academy School Board and Vice President of The Vision Foundation. He also holds memberships in the Atlanta Business League and Urban League of Young Professionals. Born and raised in Atlanta, GA, Adam makes his home in Southwest Atlanta. Like any true Southerner, he relishes a good peach cobbler whenever he can. Adam is a talented writer and artist in addition to his professional skill set and enjoys movies, drawing, poetry, and spirited debates.

(Interesting fact: his second cousin was the first African-American undergraduate student at the same university.) Adam is a member of the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors and has already earned an impressive collection of professional awards: 2016 Career Life Success Award; 2016 Career Life Producer Award; 2017 Agency Builder of The Year, Greater Atlanta; and Executive Council Member in 2017-2020 and MDRT Member 2021. \n\nAdam brings the same passion and energy to community leadership roles as he displays in his professional pursuits, serving as Chair of Atlanta Smart Academy School Board and Vice President of The Vision Foundation. He also holds memberships in the Atlanta Business League and Urban League of Young Professionals. Born and raised in Atlanta, GA, Adam makes his home in Southwest Atlanta. Like any true Southerner, he relishes a good peach cobbler whenever he can. Adam is a talented writer and artist in addition to his professional skill set and enjoys movies, drawing, poetry, and spirited debates. Don\u2019t get him started on college sports though \u2013 for Adam, it\u2019s Noles all the way!",

The long, research-packed reports he prepared for client meetings didn\u2019t seem to engage clients or provide clarity. Adam realized that to better serve clients, he needed to help them focus on what matters most\u2014making good financial decisions so they could reach their goals. From that realization, Asset-Map was born. Created first as a tool used by Adam and his staff, his wealth planning business became Asset-Map\u2019s first success story as he used it to grow revenue by 300%, three years in a row while achieving nearly $1 billion in AUM in under a decade.",

Dr. David Phillips of the University of California at San Diego found that \u201cwithin two months after every front-page suicide story, an average of fifty-eight more people than usual killed themselves.\u201d  In laughing and crying, living and dying, it would seem that the behavior of those around is far more contagious than we may have ever supposed.\nMirror neurons and other mechanisms of the brain facilitate the precious gift of empathy, an invaluable resource when building relationships and community. Though we may not have experienced exactly the same joys and sorrows, we can vicariously experience each other\u2019s emotions in a way that allows for comfort, support and even shared elation.\nBut, in what is becoming an ever-stronger theme here, the very mechanisms by which we form community and share each others\u2019 burdens make us poor investors and more concerned with keeping up with others than providing for our own needs. As Jason Zweig says, \u201c\u2026investing isn\u2019t about beating others at their game. It\u2019s about controlling yourself at your own game.\u201d",
