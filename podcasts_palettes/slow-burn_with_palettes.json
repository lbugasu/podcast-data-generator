    "description": "In 1978, state Sen. John Briggs put a bold proposition on the California ballot. If it passed, the Briggs Initiative would ban gays and lesbians from working in public schools\u2014and fuel a growing backlash against LGBTQ+ people in all corners of American life. In the ninth season of Slate\u2019s Slow Burn, host Christina Cauterucci explores one of the most consequential civil rights battles in American history: the first-ever statewide vote on gay rights. With that fight looming, young gay activists formed a sprawling, infighting, joyous opposition; confronted the smear that they were indoctrinating kids; and came out en masse to show Briggs\u2014and their own communities\u2014who they really were. And when an unthinkable act of violence shocked them all, they showed the world what gay power looked like.\n\nWant more Slow Burn?

                "summary": "(This episode originally aired in March 2020.)\nThe 1998 romantic comedy You\u2019ve Got Mail, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, is about the brutal fight between a beloved indie bookstore, the Shop Around the Corner, and Fox Books, an obvious Barnes & Noble stand-in. On this episode of Decoder Ring we revisit the real-life conflict that inspired the movie and displaced independent booksellers on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. This conflict illustrates how, for a brief time, Barnes & Noble was a symbol of predatory capitalism, only to be usurped by the uniting force at the heart of the film: the internet.\nSome of the voices in this episode include Delia Ephron, the co-screenwriter of You\u2019ve Got Mail, the illustrator Brian Selznick, Laura J. Miller, author of Reluctant Capitalists: Bookselling and the Culture of Consumption, Joel Fram, founder of Eeyore\u2019s Books for Children, and Boris Kachka, book editor for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThis podcast was written by Willa Paskin and produced by Benjamin Frisch and Cleo Levin was research assistant.\u00a0\n\nThanks to Steve Geck, Maris Kreizman, Emma Straub, Jacob Bernstein, Gary Hoover, Peter Glassman and June Thomas.\u00a0\n\nDecoder Ring is produced by Willa Paskin and Katie Shepherd.

In this episode we explore how it\u2019s connected to today\u2019s big booty craze. We look at the bustle\u2019s history with a curator fascinated by old undergarments; consider the various theories about its popularity with the author Heather Radke; and then hone in the tragic story of Sarah Baartman. The bustle may be old-fashioned, but it still has a lot to tell us about race, sex, power and how much people know, or let themselves know, about what they put on everyday.\nWe hear from Heather Radke, author of Butts: A Backstory, as well as Kristina Haughland, Janell Hobson, Pamela Scully, and Maria Garcia.\u00a0\nThis podcast was written by Willa Paskin, who produces Decoder Ring with Katie Shepherd. This episode was edited by Andrea Bruce.\u00a0Derek John is Slate\u2019s Executive Producer of Narrative Podcasts.

That narrative was largely unknown until Betty and Barney Hill went public about their own alien abduction in the 1960s. Betty Hill\u2019s niece, Kathleen Marden, recounts how the story went viral and her aunt and uncle became unwitting celebrities. Then professors Susan Lepselter, Chris Bader, Joseph O. Baker and Stephanie Kelley-Romano explain how the Hills\u2019 alien abduction changed science fiction forever.\nThanks to Eric Molinsky for bringing us this story that originally aired on his terrific podcast Imaginary Worlds. Eric\u2019s got a lot more stories like this one so subscribe wherever you listen.\u00a0\nDecoder Ring is written by Willa Paskin and produced by Willa Paskin and Katie Shepherd.

In each episode, host Willa Paskin takes a cultural question, object, or habit, examines its history, and tries to figure out what it means and why it matters.\nThis episode introduces you to Ilona Granet, who was a New York art-scene fixture who won the praise of the art world when she put up anti-harassment street signs in lower Manhattan in the mid- 1980s. Her career seemed like a sure thing, but three decades on, and so much more art later, it still hasn\u2019t materialized, even as her contemporaries are now hanging in museums. This episode is not about the familiar myth of making it, but the mystery of not making it. What happens, to an artist\u2014to anyone\u2014when they\u2019re good enough, but that\u2019s not enough?\nIf you like the show, subscribe to Decoder Ring on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you listen.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

It's an episode of Broken Record, a music podcast from Pushkin Industries, co-hosted by Malcolm Gladwell and music producer Rick Rubin. In the episode, Malcolm and Rick talk to Questlove about his memories of the MOVE police bombing in Philly, the music of his childhood, and Quest gets behind the drums to show the evolution of his playing.\u00a0\nBeing the music lover he is, Questlove can't help but turn the tables to ask Rick about his own Hip Hop history: working on the Beastie Boys' first album, License to Ill, and LL Cool J's first album, Radio. Then it all culminates in one of the best Obama stories ever. You can subscribe to Broken Record wherever you get your podcasts, and see some amazing studio session photos on Instagram,\u00a0@TheBrokenRecordPod.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "summary": "In 1978, state Sen. John Briggs put a bold proposition on the California ballot. If it passed, the Briggs Initiative would ban gays and lesbians from working in public schools\u2014and fuel a growing backlash against LGBTQ+ people in all corners of American life. In the ninth season of Slate\u2019s Slow Burn, host Christina Cauterucci explores one of the most consequential civil rights battles in American history: the first-ever statewide vote on gay rights. With that fight looming, young gay activists formed a sprawling, infighting, joyous opposition; confronted the smear that they were indoctrinating kids; and came out en masse to show Briggs\u2014and their own communities\u2014who they really were. And when an unthinkable act of violence shocked them all, they showed the world what gay power looked like.\n\nWant more Slow Burn?
