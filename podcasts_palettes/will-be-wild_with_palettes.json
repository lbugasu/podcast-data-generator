            "description": "<p><em>Will Be Wild</em> is a new 8-part series about the forces that led to the January 6th insurrection and what comes next. Through in-depth stories from a wide range of characters \u2013 from people who tried to stop the attack to those who took part \u2013 hosts Andrea Bernstein and Ilya Marritz explore the ongoing effort to bring autocracy to America, the lasting damage that effort is doing to our democracy, and the fate of our attempts to combat those anti-democratic forces. Because January 6th wasn't the end of the story, January 6th was just a practice run.</p><p>Binge all episodes exclusively and ad-free by joining Wondery+ in the Wondery App, Apple Podcasts, or Spotify.
