The news shocked Kenya and led to uproar both online and offline with many saying that the government isn\u2019t doing enough about violence against women.</p><p>Research by Africa Data Hub shows that from 2016 to 2023, over 500 femicide cases were uncovered in Kenya. Each representing a shattered life and a broken family. These numbers, though staggering, only scratch the surface of a much deeper problem rooted in intimate partner violence and systemic gender inequality. </p><p>Africa Daily\u2019s Alan Kasujja spoke to politician Esther Passaris about claims that Kenya\u2019s leaders have been quiet on this matter. He also spoke to Njeri Migwi, the founder of Usikimye, an organization working towards ending the prevalence of sexual and gender based violence. Usikimye, along with two other organisations in Kenya, have organised an anti-femicide march in multiple counties over the weekend in Kenya.</p>"
