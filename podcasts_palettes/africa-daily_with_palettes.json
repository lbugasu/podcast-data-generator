It led to the deaths of about 1,200 people, including foreign nationals, according to the Israeli government.\n \nMore than 200 others were taken to Gaza as hostages, over a hundred have since been released. </p><p>Israel retaliated with a series of air and artillery strikes in Gaza. The Hamas-led Health Ministry says more than 22,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed to date.\n \nSouth Africa subsequently filed a case against Israel at the United Nations\u2019 top court alleging that Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza amounts to an act of genocide. But Israel has dismissed this accusation, promising to fight back. The hearing officially kicks off at the Hague in the Netherlands today.</p><p>Africa Daily's Alan Kasujja has been looking at the significance of this court case.</p>"

The incident took place last month and sparked outrage.</p><p>While the ban has been welcomed by some who agree with the Lagos authorities that the riders drive dangerously, others say okadas offer faster and often cheaper means of transportation around the city.  </p><p>So in a heavily populated city like this, will Lagos manage without its okadas?</p><p>Alan Kasujja speaks to the BBC\u2019s Olivia Ndubuisi who lives and works in Lagos about what\u2019s it like living in the city and how this ban will affect locals.</p>"

His plans include gravity-defying skyscrapers, luxury apartments and places for study, work and leisure - all within a short walk of each other. The city will even have its own cryptocurrency - \"Akoin\". It's a far cry from the problems that blight many African cities: poor housing, water shortages and electricity black-outs. These futuristic cities are cropping up across the continent, but some experts wonder if they really are the utopia they seem. Sakhile Mngadi is a city councillor for Durban and an architect. He said many of the futuristic cities \"aren't really speaking to the context they live in.\" So how do you build a hi-tech city that also benefits the people that live there? That's what Alan Kasujja's been finding out in today's episode of Africa Daily</p>"
