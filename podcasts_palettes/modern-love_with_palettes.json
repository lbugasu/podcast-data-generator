Twenty years later, over a thousand Modern Love essays have been published in The New York Times, and the column is a trove of real-life love stories.\n\nDan has put so much of himself into editing the column over the years, but as he tells our host, Anna Martin, the column has influenced him, too. Today, Dan shares three Modern Love essays that have changed the way he thinks about love and relationships in his own life.\n\nAlso, Anna announces the beginning of a special series of episodes celebrating Modern Love\u2019s 20th anniversary.\n\nThe Modern Love essays mentioned in this episode are: \nOne Bouquet of Fleeting Beauty, Please \nNursing a Wound in an Appropriate Setting\nMy First Lesson in Motherhood",

He had been diagnosed with a cancer that had metastasized to his bones, and he wanted to spend the time he had left with Judah, their young son. Victoria had to make a complicated decision: to forgive her ex and allow him into Judah\u2019s life, or to close the door on Judah\u2019s relationship with his father, possibly forever.\n\nOn our season finale, we listen to Victoria\u2019s story about forgiveness.

Andrew grew up in a strict Christian household, and his parents are Indonesian immigrants, so they never spoke about sex at home. When Andrew was 20, he met his first girlfriend, Sam. He felt his cultural and parental influences putting \u201cpressure on my blood vessels, not allowing the blood to go where I oh so desperately wanted it to,\u201d he wrote in his Modern Love essay in 2011.</p><p>According to Andrew\u2019s Muslim American friend, his fears were the result of the \u201cham sandwich\u201d effect: the feeling of shame when you\u2019re breaking family tradition. Today, we unpack this metaphor \u2014 and then we hear from Andrew.
