    "description": "The inventor of facial recognition software was years ahead of the competition but never got credit for his work because it was kept secret by the CIA. The first VR glove was a groundbreaking piece of tech that would eventually become one of the gaming industry's biggest flops. And when Kodak execs were shown an early prototype of the first digital camera, they flat out rejected the idea. \n\nIn each episode of Ahead of Its Time, you'll explore the forgotten origins of today\u2019s most transformative technology, hear from the people who first imagined it, delve into their past and relive their eureka moments. \n\nJoin host, podcast producer and queen of tech storytelling Julia Furlan to discover why these inventors struggled to get their ideas off the ground. Then meet the next generation of innovators who are building on the work of the tech underdogs who came before them.",

Then we\u2019ll hear from his good friend Eric Fossum who explains how he miniaturized that technology to help NASA explore the solar system.\n"

The first VR glove was a groundbreaking piece of tech that would eventually become one of the gaming industry's biggest flops. And when Kodak execs were shown an early prototype of the first digital camera, they flat out rejected the idea. \n\nIn each episode of Ahead of Its Time, you'll explore the forgotten origins of today\u2019s most transformative technology, hear from the people who first imagined it, delve into their past and relive their eureka moments. \n\nJoin host, podcast producer and queen of tech storytelling Julia Furlan to discover why these inventors struggled to get their ideas off the ground. Then meet the next generation of innovators who are building on the work of the tech underdogs who came before them."
