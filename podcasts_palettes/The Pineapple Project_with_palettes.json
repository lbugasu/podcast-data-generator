We'll look at spending less, spending better and understanding why we buy things in the first place. It's like getting a pay rise without having to do anything! \n\nSo we're getting FRUGAL\u2026(WTF does frugal mean?! It means not being wasteful). We're giving you easy ways to save money on fashion, pets, travel, cars, phones, food and at the gym. So join Nazeem for an eight-part adventure into our wallets and our minds to see why we spend, where we waste money, and what we can do about it.\n            \n        ",

If you have a floor-drobe (or a chair-drobe) if you're sleeping next to white goods, or you can't remember the last time you made your bed, welcome to your new happy place. \n\nClaire Hooper meets organiser Lissanne Oliver who shares a rapid-fire method for getting bedrooms under control at the home of Karen and Gary (they have two sets of twins and weirdly their bedroom isn't the tranquil retreat they've longed for). \n\nWe learn a couple of fundamental rules for getting kids' rooms in order. And Claire has a few big moments of clarity thanks to declutter genie Peter Walsh. It's time to make the place you sleep and get weird with your partner \u2014 or yourself \u2014 your favourite place to be."
