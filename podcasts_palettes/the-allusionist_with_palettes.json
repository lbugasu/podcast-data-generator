Today: a list of the characters who don't have names in film credits. Find out more, and read the transcript, at theallusionist.org/person-in-scene.</p> <p>Content note: this episode contains some terminology from the original film credits that I do not endorse, plus one Category B swear and four Category A swears (which I endorse just fine).</p> <p>Enormous thanks to Jez Burrows for letting me use some 2,700 of these that he had collected for his book And Introducing. Find it and his other work - including his book Dictionary Stories, short stories composed of the example sentences from dictionaries - at jezburrows.com.</p> <p>The music is by Martin Austwick. Hear his songs at palebirdmusic.com, and his podcasts Neutrino Watch and Song By Song in the usual podplaces.</p> <p>Help keep this independent podcast alive by becoming a member of the Allusioverse at theallusionist.org/donate; your additional perks include regular livestreams with readings from my dictionaries, inside scoop of the making of every episode, and watchalong parties (lately, weekly gatherings to watch Great Pottery Throwdown) - AND to hang out with your fellow Allusionauts in our delightful Discord community, where I am posting all my best/worst portmanteaus and portmantNOs.</p> <p>The Allusionist's online home is theallusionist.org.

                    "description": "<p>All aboard, we're off to the 2023 Apple Festival at the University of British Columbia, to taste some apples and, most importantly, enjoy some apple names. And before that, we return to the classic Sporklusionist applesode to refresh our memory about how apple names are chosen - eponyms, portmanteaus, geography, or corporate R&amp;D, just like how our ancestors named apples.</p> <p>Dan Pashman hosts The Sporkful podcast - head to the Sporkful podfeed or sporkful.com to listen to the companion episode where we learn about how new varietals of apples are made. Kate Evans, Kathryn Grandy and Joanna Crosby explain the history of apple names and the current process for coining new ones.</p> <p>My companions at the apple festival are Hannah McGregor of Material Girls podcast, and Martin Austwick of Neutrino Watch and Song By Song podcasts. Martin also provides the Allusionist music.</p> <p>Find out more about this episode and the topics therein, read the transcript, and see pictures of the apple festival at theallusionist.org/applefest.</p> <p>Become a member of the Allusioverse at theallusionist.org/donate and as well as keeping this independent podcast going, you get regular livestreams and watchalong parties - AND to hang out with your fellow Allusionauts in our delightful Discord community.

Or a fun international TV event that brings people together in lots of different countries? Or watching extremely vigorous dance numbers? OK, it<em> is</em>, but it's also about some pretty thorny language-related politics. Historian <a>Dean Vuletic</a>,\u00a0author of <em>Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest</em>, discusses Eurovision's many linguistic controversies, and the ways the contest has been exploited politically - and caused political kick-offs too.</p> <p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">This is the second instalment of a two-part Eurovisionallusionist. In the first part: a whole lot of tussling about which languages to compete in.</p> <p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Find out more about this episode at <a>theallusionist.org/eurovision2</a>, where there's also a transcript.</p> <p>The Allusionist's online home is <a href=\"http://theallusionist.org/\">theallusionist.org</a>.

                    "description": "<p>From whitewash (the paint) we got whitewashing (the covering up of misdeeds) and from there greenwashing, redwashing, bluewashing, purplewashing, pinkwashing - and now rainbow washing, where companies will put Pride flags all over products and posts during the month of June, but behind the scenes will not necessarily be useful - and sometimes they'll be anti-useful. Mitra Kaboli, host of the new podcast Welcome to Provincetown, helps sort the real allyship from the rainbow-washing; and writer Sarah Schulman, who popularised the term 'pinkwashing', explains the more political meaning of that word.</p> <p>This episode contains some swears.</p> <p>Find out more information about the topics in this episode at <a href=\"http://theallusionist.org/rainbow-washing\">theallusionist.org/rainbow-washing</a>, plus a transcript and the full dictionary entry for the randomly selected word.</p> <p>Sign up to be a patron at <a href=\"http://patreon.com/allusionist\">patreon.com/allusionist</a> and not only are you supporting an independent podcast, you get patron-exclusive video livestreams and a Discord community full of language chat, craft pics and word game camaraderie.</p> <p>The Allusionist's online home is <a href=\"http://theallusionist.org/\">theallusionist.org</a>.

What&rsquo;s it FOR? How did it GET there? Will it go AWAY now please? It is, at the very least, taking up brainspace and not paying any rent.</p> <p>This is a recording of a live performance at the Blueberry Hill Duck Room in St Louis, Missouri on 23 November 2019, and there were visuals happening, so I&rsquo;ll drop in sometimes to explain them, and I&rsquo;ve also put a transcript and pictures at <a href=\"http://theallusionist.org/notitle\">theallusionist.org/notitle</a>.</p> <p>There are swears in this. There are also arguments that will be very useful to you if you ever come up against a denier of singular they. You will definitely win.</p> <p>The show features Martin Austwick and Richard Zaltzman. The original music is by Martin Austwick. Hear Martin&rsquo;s songs at <a href=\"http://palebirdmusic.com\">palebirdmusic.com </a>or on Spotify, and he&rsquo;s @martinaustwick on Twitter and Instagram. He also composed the music for the new kids&rsquo; science podcast Maddie&rsquo;s Sound Explorers.</p> <p>I make two other podcasts, Veronica Mars Investigations and Answer Me This.</p> <p>The Allusionist's online home is <a href=\"http://theallusionist.org/\">theallusionist.org</a>.

                    "description": "<p>On 9 November 1989, the demolition of the Berlin Wall began. Within a year, Germany was unified. East Germany dissolved and was incorporated into the Federal Republic of Germany, took on its currency and its rules - and its lexicon.

What was that vocabulary, and where did it go?</p> <p>Go to <a href=\"http://theallusionist.org/eastwest\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">theallusionist.org/eastwest </a>to find out more about this episode and the people who appear on it.</p> <p>The Allusionist's online home is <a href=\"http://theallusionist.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">theallusionist.org</a>.

Professor Paul Baker, author of the Polari dictionary and the new book Fabulosa! The Story of Polari, Britain\u2019s Secret Gay Language, explains how Polari emerged from criminal cant and London\u2019s theatres and docks to be used a code language for gay men in the oppressive 1950s - and then, not long after, it entered the slang lexicons of the general public, via popular sketch comedy and the mouth of an annoyed princess.",
