The episode starts with a discussion about VAR overturning a brilliant Martinelli goal and the impact on the game. There\u2019s a section on the dominance that followed from Arsenal and the way Arsenal were able to control the game and push United back. There\u2019s a big section on the issues that lead to the goals, specifically in midfield and more specifically the performance of Sambi Lokonga. Then the group discusses the subs, the way the game played out from 1-1 to 3-1 and the nature of the performance overall. There\u2019s a look ahead to the Europa League lineup and how much rotation we might see.

The discussion starts by comparing the elation of the result with reactions to the performance. The group dissects the use of Saka this season, the effectiveness of the pressing we\u2019 did, and another star turn from Smith Rowe. There are questions about whether Odegaard is the player we need going forward, as well as reactions to Arteta\u2019s post match comments. Finally the group reacts to the stats about Arsenal\u2019s results since Boxing Day.

                "summary": "On this edition of the Arsenal Vision Post Match Podcast, Kroenke Sports and Entertainment\u2019s ownership of Arsenal is discussed and debated. First Elliot (@yankeegunner) is joined by Matt (@giantgooner) for a forensic financial analysis of KSE. First they discuss the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the club, and then they explore KSE\u2019s ability to fund the club for success. After that, Elliot is joined by Tim (@stillberto), Clive (@clivepafc) and Paul (@poznaninmypants) to cover all the bases regarding the owner. They explore how it felt when he first arrived and the early ownership period. Then they debate the idea of a self-sustaining model, whether Arsenal can succeed under KSE and what makes a good owner in modern football. There\u2019s plenty of debate about mistakes that have been made and a final discussion about how long KSE will stick around.

                "summary": "On this edition of the Arsenal Vision Post Match Podcast, Elliot (@yankeegunner) is joined by Clive (@clivepafc) and Andrew (@arseblog) to discuss another disappointing result at Leicester. The pod starts out with some basic reaction to the game plan at the King Power stadium and questions about whether Arsenal should be approaching a game at Leicester in that manner. There\u2019s a bit of tactical discussion and talk about the substitutions, before the attention turns squarely to the head coach and whether he can possibly remain in charge. After focusing on Emery, the pod attempts to answer whether Raul Sanllehi and Edu have things under control and what to make of the noises coming out of the club that seem to suggest Emery is staying and potentially point a finger at the fans as a part of the problem.

Naturally Xhaka\u2019s performance is in the spotlight from the beginning and the group wonders about his selection and future in the team. The tactical issues with the first half are examined as well as the litany of errors for the first goal. Then the discussion focuses on the good and bad of the big 3 up front. There\u2019s huge praise for Guendouzi and questions about Torreira\u2019s deployment. The substitutions are discussed as are both goals, and there\u2019s a bit on Mkhitaryan as well.

After a very short discussion of a failed light show, the group discusses Arsenal\u2019s slow start to the game, the first goal, and the decision to start Cech. Then things move on to the strikers, their immense performance, the missed chances, and the quality of the goals. There\u2019s a debate about the midfield pairing and Arsenal\u2019s pressing in the Europa League plus a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of Kolasinac. Finally the group looks ahead to the second leg and the last two weeks of the league season.

Then the group assess the causes of a sluggish first half performance with a focus on Ramsey, Elneny, Mkhitaryan and the full backs. There\u2019s a section on Torreira and the way his involvement improved Guendouzi. There\u2019s discussion of Aubameyang\u2019s contribution and Danny Welbeck\u2019s importance to the team. Lastly there\u2019s a preview of the weekend\u2019s match at Crystal Palace.
