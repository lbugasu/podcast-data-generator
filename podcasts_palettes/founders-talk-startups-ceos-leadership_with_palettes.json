                    "description": "This week Adam is joined by Joe Percoco \u2014 the Co-CEO of Titan, a premier investment manager for everyone. Titan is an investment company, a media, and a tech company, all rolled into one. Mid last year, they closed a $58 million Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) at a $450 million valuation. They currently have $750 million in assets managed and more than 35,000 clients.\n\nWhy should Titan exist? In Joe's words, \"Wall Street ignores everyday investors, and caters only to the ultra wealthy. This divide doesn't sit well with us. So, we built Titan.\" On today's show Joe shares the journey, the why's, the how's, and the sequencing it might take to get to a $1 trillion of assets managed.",
