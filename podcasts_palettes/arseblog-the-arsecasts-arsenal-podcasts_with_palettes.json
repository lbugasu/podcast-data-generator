We chat about Arsenal's control in the first half, the goals we scored, and the importance of Aaron Ramsdale's performance \u2013 not least the timing of some of his saves. There's spotlight on Martin Odegaard as his fine form continues, how different this was from the game last May and why, and the unseemly scenes at the end of the game and Spurs culpability in that regard. We also answer listener questions about transfers after Mykhaylo Mudryk signed for Chelsea, what now for Arsenal in the market? Plus questions about Oleksandr Zinchenko, pivotal results in Mikel Arteta's tenure, Gabriel's consistency and lots more.</p><br><p>Video of Arsenal fan in Spurs end: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/allsparkswill/status/1614715131941756928\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/allsparkswill/status/1614715131941756928</a></p><br><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about the quality of Arsenal's performance from start to finish, and how the technical level of this team is key to what we're doing right now. There's discussion of Gabriel Jesus and his performance versus another striker's; other individuals who stood out; rendering Chelsea ineffective; and some props for Mikel Arteta's role in the improvement of the team and the club as a whole. We also answer questions about Aubameyang's pre-game video, Granit Xhaka's increased contribution, the manager and his technical area, Ben White and lots more.</p><br><p>We also announce the official Arsecast Extra Goodly Morning mug is on sale, with all proceeds going to charity.

We talk about the player, the deal, what he'll bring to the team next season, and the fact he's made it clear he's coming in as the number 9 and what we can expect in that regard. There's plenty of ancillary Jesus discussion too, as well as a look at the other transfers thus far, plus listener questions about what would constitute a successful window, what might happen with returning loan players like Hector Bellerin and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, competing against big clubs for good players, Arsenal Women transfer rumours and LOADS more.</p><br><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about notable pre-game absences and a team which didn't look ready in spite of those, the goals we conceded, Bernd Leno, a wobbly defence, some positive stuff from the likes of Smith Rowe, Tierney and Lokonga, what bringing on a left-back at right back might mean, and more. As well as that there are loads of listener questions about Mikel Arteta and the kind of football we play, what will it take to make it go 'bang', the manager's comments about Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, whether we should revert to a back three, and plenty more, plus the winners of the competition to win signed copies of James' book.</p><br><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Then we delve into the latest transfer rumours, including left-backs and right-backs, and ask whether we need to readjust our expectations when it comes to the kind of fees we might receive for the players we're looking to sell this summer. Then we answer listener questions about our reported interest in Aaron Ramsdale, whether the 're-sale' model actually makes sense when you consider who might be able to buy players from us, Ben White, William Saliba and the Olympics, why transfers take so long to go through, and lots more.</p><br><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about the deployment of Emile Smith Rowe as a 'False 9', conceding the goals we did, a disaster-class in midfield from Dani Ceballos and the manager's role in his sending off, Bukayo Saka winning a penalty and the ice-cold way Nicolas Pepe put it away to salvage something from a really poor night against Unai Emery's team. There's also a little gratitude for the former head coach, plus plenty of questions about Mikel Arteta, his use of subs, his over-complication at times, expectations of him, plus a bit about the takeover bid from Daniel Ek and lots more.</p><br><p><a href=\"https://arsebiz.arseblog.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Arsebiz</a> to support fellow Gooners.</p><br><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

A superb first half performance took a dark twist in injury time, and there's discussion of David Luiz, the penalty incident and the red card. We also chat about going down to 9 men when Bernd Leno was sent off in the second half, and the frustration of how quickly a game can change when it looks like you're in control. However, there were positives, things for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal fans to enjoy, and we talk about how we might respond to the way this match played out. There also listener questions about our disciplinary record, goalkeeping worries with Leno suspended, Mustafi moments, Aubameyang returning to the starting line-up and lots more.</p><br><p>Subscribe to us on Patreon for exclusive content, extra podcasts, Discord chat and lots more: <a href=\"https://patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

The Scottish international had a storming game, scored a fantastic opening goal, and there's so much to like about his game and his character. We also chat about Arsenal's brilliant second goal, and the two strikes for Alexandre Lacazette which capped an excellent all-round performance. Then we answer listener questions, with a lot of focus on central defenders. There's talk of Rob Holding and a potential new contract; should Gabriel come straight back in for Pablo Mari?; William Saliba's situation and his imminent loan to Nice; as well as further questions about Nicolas Pepe, Lacazette's contract, and the medium-term work the club have to consider for the striking position, and LOTS more.</p><br><p><a href=\"https://arsebiz.arseblog.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Arsebiz</a> to support fellow Gooners.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

We then chat about the match, goals for Alex Lacazette, Pablo Mari, Eddie Nketiah and Emile Smith Rowe, and an excellent performance from Ainsley Maitland-Niles, but does it put him in contention to start the derby on Sunday? There also questions about Arteta's desire to play a 4-3-3, the visit to White Hart Lane and the importance of not losing, blue kits at home, the use of young players, a possible January clearout and loads more.</p><br><p>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/i/greeting-card/Goodly-Christmas-by-arseblog/62566466.5MT14?asc=u\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Goodly Christmas card here</a> \u2013 all proceeds go to the Arsenal Foundation.</p><br><p><a href=\"https://arsebiz.arseblog.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Arsebiz</a> to support fellow Gooners.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Then it's the football, and although we intended to analyse the game in some detail, it quickly became a very broad discussion about what's going at the club right now.

After that, we discuss what it means in this crazy season to have ended with success, the job Mikel Arteta has done and the impact he's made since taking the job in December, what the future holds for the club and certain players, how European football has an impact, and we also relive some of the best/funniest moments from the day along with LOTS more in this almost two hour long episode.\n\nAlso, a big thanks to all our listeners for being here throughout this long, trying season, and we're so happy we've been able to end it on a high note for everyone!\n\n Hosted on Acast.

We examine the red card, the roles of Mustafi and Luiz, but focus on the Arsenal response including Gabriel Martinelli's brilliant goal, Hector Bellerin's late equaliser, Granit Xhaka playing superbly at centre-half, the hugely positive Bukayo Saka and what this result and performance might mean for the team, the manager and the fans.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Tim and Pippa chat with Annemarie about her experiences of talking to Danielle van de Donk, Vivianne Miedema and Jill Roord, as well as the perception of them back home and their roles with the national team. The panel chat about departed Dutchies Dominique Bloodworth and Sari van Veenendaal too- both of whom left the club this summer.</p><br><p>Tim chats to Vivianne Miedema and Jill Roord exclusively for this episode and also talks to Leah Williamson about Vivianne Miedema as a teammate.

It was the first time they'd seen each other in years, and on Wednesday you'll be able to watch the conversation they had on Ian's YouTube channel.

We also chat about some of the young players making their breakthroughs at Arsenal right now, and in particular Ian's mentoring of Eddie Nketiah who is out on loan at Leeds.</p><br><p><a href=\"https://youtube.com/ianwright\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe to Ian's YouTube channel here</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

James and I reflect on the Barcelona game and pre-season as a whole, as well as gauging our readiness as the Premier League looms. There's been excitement in the transfer market, and from young players, but there are question marks hanging over certain areas of the team, in particular the defence. Will we be able to find answers before the transfer window closes on Thursday? Then we have lots of listener questions about our centre-half situation, what kind of a season we can expect from Mesut Ozil, loaning or keeping young players, our line-up for Sunday and loads more besides.&nbsp;<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

All that and much more, including listener questions throughout the show, including transfer targets, young players from the Academy, and, of course, our chances of success in Baku.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

It\u2019s a unique achievement and one that remains unequaled to this day. The Gunners went into that campaign having fallen short of a double the season before, and with minimal summer spending.&nbsp;</p><br><p>The squad was small but with players like Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires, Dennis Bergkamp and, of course, Thierry Henry at the peak of their powers, and with a strong supporting cast, Arsenal did something unbelievable.</p><br><p>It was a season with ups and downs, highs and lows, but it\u2019s one that still remains fresh in the memory. Join me, Andrew Allen and James from Gunnerblog as we revisit the 2003-04 season as Arsenal became Invincible.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

                "summary": "A third defeat in a week has left Arsenal's chances of finishing in the top four very remote, but it has precipitated the longest Arsecast Extra of all time. James and I discuss the Leicester game, Unai Emery's approach, and the result in the context of our recent form which has seen us lose four of our last five league games. We chat about the squad, what needs to be done, the manager and his work, the ownership, the structures we're supposed to have in place but don't, our recruitment needs this summer, and loads more besides. There's a lot of introspection, plenty of confusion, a smidgen of bewilderment and probably no satisfactory answers but Arsenal's situation right now is a long way from black and white.

We discuss the goals we conceded, the hapless nature of our defending, how badly we defending, what a load of rubbish we were at the back, and how we can't defend to save our lives. How much is on personnel and how much is on Unai Emery? Then there's the Mesut Ozil situation AGAIN, and why moving him on in January might well be the best thing for the club if we can make it happen, and we have listener questions about what we might do when transfer window opens, where the money might come from, we talk about how bad transfer business has been over the last few seasons, and lots more.

We answer questions about the Sven Mislintat impact, the other signings we might make as well as our traditional predictions about how we'll spend between now and the end of the transfer window, which players might improve under Emery and lots more.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about the potential impact of the window closing before the season starts, how clubs will react, if it will change the way they operate, and look at Arsenal's start to the season. After that I'm joined by Michael Cox from Zonal Marking to discuss Arsenal's back three, and the potential return of the manager to a back four, something he's much more comfortable with. Who will be the winners and losers of the formation change, and how can Arsene Wenger fix that midfield issue.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
