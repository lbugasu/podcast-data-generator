They also consider how the eldest sibling can set the tone of the household, how much of our difficult emotions we should share with our children, and Mayim\u2019s process of \"boring herself to sleep.\" Eric talks about his musical influences, the origins of his own musicality, the rollercoaster turn of events after being signed to Madonna\u2019s record label, and who his songs are actually about. He explains why he chooses to lean into his depression in order to connect with his fans, his focus on staying present, and his emotional outlets apart from music. Mayim and Eric wrap the episode with a spontaneous jam session where they perform one of Eric\u2019s songs together!"

            "content": "<p>Dr. Becky Kennedy (clinical psychologist, founder of <i>Good Inside</i> parenting workshops, author) helps us use attachment, mindfulness, emotion regulation, and internal family systems theory to break down better ways to parent! She not only provides great, practical parenting tips, but also helps us understand our own upbringings, how they impact our lives into adulthood, and provides insight into why our parents did the things they did. Dr. Becky discusses why she found the best way to work with children was actually working with their parents through body-based approaches to psychotherapy, her own paradigm shift in parenting styles, and the differences between attachment parenting and helicopter parenting. She explains the importance of wiring kids for resilience with self-soothing techniques in order to ditch old patterns of behavior, building skills to manage emotions through validation, and how to provide kids with tools to process difficult emotions. Mayim and Dr. Becky define reflective listening, boundaries vs consequences, and how feeling alone can lead to shame and fears of abandonment. They discuss the benefits of learning to embody your authority as a parent, ways to provide structure to a child with anxiety, and the benefits of internal family systems (IFS) therapy.

He details health conditions you may not know have stress-related causes and explains why healthy attachment and meeting a child\u2019s needs is even more important than we think. Dr. Mat\u00e9 identifies characteristics of those who are prone to chronic illness, reveals why autoimmune diseases predominantly affect women, and discusses the dangers of systematic denial of our emotions.

Lauren opens up about her mother\u2019s battle with Alzheimer\u2019s at an early age, and how her mother\u2019s diagnosis affected the early stages of her relationship with Seth. Seth and Lauren discuss the ripples of mental health struggles on an entire family, why treating and preventing Alzheimer\u2019s can be so difficult, and the benefits of familiarizing yourself with symptoms of neurological diseases. They explain potential causes of early onset Alzheimer\u2019s, lifestyle changes that can help promote brain health, and the positive and negative effects of marijuana use on brain health.

            "content": "<p>Nora McInerny (<i>Terrible, Thanks for Asking</i> podcast, author of <i>Bad Vibes Only</i>) helps us build understanding around grief by taking us through her own grief journey. She discusses what her life was like before suffering extreme loss, what happened upon receiving her husband\u2019s terminal brain cancer diagnosis, and how she dealt with a miscarriage and the loss of her father and husband weeks apart. Nora and Mayim consider the struggle of dealing with people\u2019s expectations of your feelings during mourning periods, why it may be difficult to relate to people who are moving through grief, and the importance of allowing oneself time to truly grieve. They discuss reasons why mourning is so specific and individualistic, productivity associated with grief, and the benefits of finding a support group.

He details his class clown and theatre beginnings, finding his comedy partner in Kenan Thompson, and the impact of the diversity shown on <i>All That</i>. Kel draws comparisons between his childhood in the southside of Chicago where he lost loved ones to gun and gang violence and the trauma young celebrities face in Hollywood. He discusses getting married at an early age and dealing with anxiety stemming from confusion over whether people loved him for his comedy characters or his true self. Kel opens up about his suicide attempt, how his faith led him to pursue a path toward mental wellness, and his journey to becoming a youth pastor.

She details her path to becoming a suicide prevention advocate and shares how her own mental health journey during medical school led her to become a safe space for others. Dr. Moutier lists the occupations with the highest risk of suicide, the suicide patterns across every demographic, and the physical, emotional, and psychological factors that increase one\u2019s risk. Mayim opens up about her family\u2019s experience with suicide and highlights the importance of not waiting to seek help. She and Dr. Moutier consider the elevated suicide rates among LGBTQIA+ communities, the role social media plays in cyberbullying and suicide, and the importance of combating the epidemic of loneliness with interpersonal connections.
