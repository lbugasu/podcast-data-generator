                    "itunes:summary": "Southside Tribe!! In this crucial new episode, we shine a light on the dangers of Christian nationalism (once again) and its impact on both faith and politics. From historical precedents to contemporary challenges, we explore how the fusion of religious identity with nationalistic fervor can distort the principles of Christianity and undermine Jesus's central message of love, humility and global vision. Join us as we dissect the ways in which some politicians can manipulate scripture and religious authority to advance personal agendas, and the ramifications this has on society at large. Join us as we defend the authentic teachings of the Bible and safeguard against the hijacking of faith for sociopolitical and financial gains. Tune in for a candid discussion on navigating the delicate balance between faith and civic responsibility in an increasingly polarized world.\n\nFull episode on all audio platforms, video and bonus content on our Patreon community!! \nBecome a Patreon member for Early Access & Exclusive Content - https://patreon.com/Southsiderabbi\n\nFollow us Online:\nSouthsiderabbipodcast.com\nhttps://linktr.ee/southsiderabbi\nGoogle Podcasts - https://tinyurl.com/2p9ewhwe\n\nEmail us at Southsiderabbipodcast@gmail.com\n\nSouthside Rabbi is proudly sponsored by Native Supply - grab SR merch there!\nhttps://www.native.supply\nhttps://native.supply/collections/southside-rabbi\n\nSouthside Rabbi is proudly sponsored by TENx10\nVisit Tenx10.org\n\nIntro music produced by Randeaux- https://www.instagram.com/randeauxbandeaux/\nContact at randeauxbandeaux@gmail.com\nOutro music produced by KB.\n\nAll rights reserved by their respective owners.\n\n#KB #Ameen #Podcast",
