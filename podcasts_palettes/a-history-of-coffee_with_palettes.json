            "description": "A History of Coffee is the story of how a tiny psychoactive seed changed the world and shapes our lives today. \n\nAcross six episodes, documentary maker James Harper and professional historian Jonathan Morris narrate how humans race coffee across oceans to keep up with demand for this addictive drink. \n\nCoffee creates enormous fortunes for some, and misery for others. Sometimes the environment benefits, but more often it is plundered. \n\nIf we want to make coffee a more equitable industry that\u2019s also kinder to the environment, a place to start is understanding the stories and systems that put the coffee into your cup this morning. \n\nPress the Subscribe button so you don\u2019t miss future episodes!\n\nFollow Jonathan Morris @coffeehistoryjm and James Harper @filterstoriespodcast. \n\nRead full transcripts at www.historyofcoffee.org.",
