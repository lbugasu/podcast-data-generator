I tried to use the Remarkable 2 for DTNS prep and it just didn\u2019t make any sense.\n\n\nThe Remarkable 2 is powerhouse for anyone annotating documents, sketching, freeform stuff. Although you can sync over WIFI and email documents easily from the tablet, it\u2019s not really \u201conline\u201d.\nLove the form factor, I don\u2019t think it would work at a smaller size.\nIf you reach for your notepad regularly, you will love this tablet.\nPricing feels high, especially for the subscription options.\nFIN\nFollow us on Twitter Instgram YouTube and Twitch\nPlease SUBSCRIBE HERE.\nSubscribe through Apple Podcasts.\nA special thanks to all our supporters\u2013without you, none of this would be possible.\nIf you are willing to support the show or to give as little as 10 cents a day on Patreon, Thank you!\nBecome a Patron!\nBig thanks to Dan Lueders for the headlines music and Martin Bell for the opening theme!\nBig thanks to Mustafa A. from thepolarcat.com for the logo!\nThanks to our mods Jack_Shid and KAPT_Kipper on the subreddit\nSend to email to feedback@dailytechnewsshow.com\nShow Notes.",
