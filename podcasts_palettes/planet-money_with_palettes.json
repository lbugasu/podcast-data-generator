And many of these pose a real threat to even the most savvy of depositors.\nWhen a little known tech company filed for bankruptcy a few months ago, thousands of people couldn't access the millions of dollars they saved. On today's show, we meet some of the people affected and learn what the fintech industry reveals about banking regulation.\nToday's show was hosted by Erika Beras and Sally Helm. It was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler and Sofia Shchukina with help from James Sneed. It was edited by Jess Jiang and fact-checked by Kevin Volkl. It was engineered by Valentina Rodr\u00edguez S\u00e1nchez with help from James Willetts. Alex Goldmark is our executive producer.\nHelp support Planet Money and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org/planetmoney.\nLearn more about sponsor message choices: podcastchoices.com/adchoices\nNPR Privacy Policy",

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Last weekend we were all thrown for a loop when President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris for the nomination. Just like everyone else, we are trying to quickly wrap our heads around what it means now that Harris is almost certainly going to be the Democratic nominee for president. \nWe expect to see the Harris campaign come out with some official policy proposals in the coming weeks and months. But for now, all we've got are clues, little breadcrumbs that she has dropped throughout her career that might lead us to a rough idea of what economic policies she might support. \nToday on the show, we're going to visit three key moments from Harris' political career that might give us an idea of how her economic agenda might look. First, the 2019 presidential primary debates, where she laid out her own economic policies. Next, a vote in her Senate years that shows where she might fall on future trade agreements. And finally, a fight with some of the country's biggest banks from her very first year as Attorney General of California. \nThis episode was hosted by Keith Romer and Nick Fountain.

Most of the inconveniences we think about when we fly can be traced back to the period of time just after the federal government deregulated the airlines. <br/><br/>When commercial air travel took off in the 1940s, the government regulated how many national airlines were allowed to exist, where they were allowed to fly, and how much they could charge for tickets.

Does a surge of immigration hurt their wages? \nThe debate within the field of economics often centers on Nobel-prize winner David Card's ground-breaking paper, \"The Impact of the Mariel Boatlift on the Miami Labor Market.\" Today on the show: the fight over that paper, and what it tells us about the debate over immigration. \nMore Listening:\n - When The Boats Arrive\n - The Men on the Roof\nThis episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Jeff Guo.

But when we asked the packaging and pricing experts, they told us that shrinkflation is just one move in a much larger, much weirder 4-D chess game. <br/><br/>The name of that game is \"price pack architecture.\" This is the idea that you shouldn't just sell your product in one or two sizes. You should sell your product in a whole range of different sizes, at a whole range of different price points. Over the past 15 years, price pack architecture has completely changed how products are marketed and sold in the United States. <br/><br/>Today, we are going on a shopping cart ride-along with one of those price pack architects.

            "contentSnippet": "For thousands of years, getting light was a huge hassle. You had to make candles from scratch. This is not as romantic as it sounds. You had to get a cow, raise the cow, feed the cow, kill the cow, get the fat out of the cow, cook the fat, dip wicks into the fat. All that--for not very much light. Now, if we want to light a whole room, we just flip a switch.\nThe history of light explains why the world today is the way it is. It explains why we aren't all subsistence farmers, and why we can afford to have artists and massage therapists and plumbers. (And, yes, people who make podcasts about the history of light.) The history of light is the history of economic growth--of things getting faster, cheaper, and more efficient.\nOn today's show: How we got from dim little candles made out of cow fat, to as much light as we want at the flick of a switch.\nToday's show was hosted by Jacob Goldstein and David Kestenbaum.

It has nothing to do with you or your performance. We're just changing priorities, making a strategic shift.\" <br/><br/>It's like the business version of: \"It's not you, it's me.\" And just like a breakup, it feels terrible. <br/><br/>This happened to a man we're calling V, who was working at the same company as his husband when he got laid off.

Mike is a lawyer in Kansas City, Missouri, and his friend, Brandon Boulware, another lawyer, was calling about a case he wanted Mike to get involved with. Mike was an unusual choice - he's a personal injury lawyer, and this was going to be an antitrust case. <br/><br/>But Brandon knew Mike was great in front of a jury. And that he'd won huge settlements for his clients in the past. <br/><br/>So the lawyer friend drops by Mike's office, and pitches him the case. Rhonda and Scott Burnett had just sold their home for $250,000, and out of that amount, they had paid $15,000 in commission (plus a small fee), which was split between two real estate agents - even though they had hired only one. And the commission was high - 6%. Mike's friend said the whole thing seemed... suspicious. Maybe even illegal. <br/><br/>Mike agreed to take the case, a case that would soon become bigger than one about just what had happened to the Burnetts. It would become a fight about the way homes are bought and sold in the U.S. and challenge the way real estate agents have done business for more than 100 years. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Keith Romer.

The company, which launched in the fall of 2022, has been flooding the American advertising market, buying much of the inventory of Facebook, Snapchat, and beyond. According to the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Temu is one of the most downloaded iPhone apps in the country, with around 50 million monthly active users.<br/><br/>On today's show, we go deep on Temu: How does it work, how did it manage such a quick rise in the U.S., and what hints might it offer us about the future of retail?

Hidden in the flop for this auction are some keys to what it takes to spark a whole new market, quickly. \nThen, the booming side of wind power: the job that's projected to be the fastest-growing in the U.S. is wind turbine service technician. Is it a \"good\" job? Reporter Darian Woods suits up to see a green-collar job above the clouds for himself.\nToday's episode is adapted from episodes for Planet Money's daily show, The Indicator.

But it's pretty weird, right?<br/><br/>Why do schools turn kids into little salespeople? And why do we let companies come in and dangle prizes in front of students?<br/><br/>We spend a year with one elementary school, following their fundraising efforts, to see how much they raise, and what the money goes to. <br/><br/>The school \u2013 Villacorta Elementary in La Puente, California \u2013 has one big goal: To raise enough money to send every single student on one field trip. The whole school hasn't been able to go on one in three years. <br/><br/>We find out what  the companies who run school fundraisers do to try to win a school's business. And we find that this bizarre tradition is ... surprisingly tactical. That's on today's episode. <br/><br/><em>Today's show was hosted by Sarah Gonzalez and produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Here at Planet Money, Thanksgiving is not just a time to feast on turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, green bean casseroles and pie(s). It's also a time to feast on economics. Today, we host a very Planet Money Thanksgiving feast, and solve a few economic questions along the way.\nFirst: a turkey mystery. Around the holidays, demand for turkey at grocery stores goes up by as much as 750%. And when turkey demand is so high, you might think that the price of turkey would also go up. But data shows, the price of whole turkeys actually falls around the holidays; it goes down by around 20%. So what's going on? The answer has to do what might be special about supply and demand around the holidays. \nWe also reveal what is counted (and not counted) in the ways we measure the economy. \nAnd we look to economics to help solve the perennial Thanksgiving dilemma: Where should each dinner guest sit? Who should sit next to whom? \nThis episode was hosted by Erika Beras and Jeff Guo. It was produced by James Sneed with an assist from Emma Peaslee and edited by Jess Jiang.

Buffets.\nHere at Planet Money we believe there's a lot of economics going on at the all-you-eat buffet, tucked in between the mountains of brisket and troughs of mashed potatoes. From classic concepts like adverse selection, sunk costs, diminishing marginal returns, to more exotic economic mysteries, like the flat rate pricing bias.\nToday on the show, we're headed to the place where the modern buffet may have been born: Las Vegas. Our mission? To feast ourselves on all the economics we can handle at the all-you-can-eat buffet.

It's about modeling, and weighing the costs of messing up vs. missing out. For instance, take a newspaper vendor who has to decide how many newspapers to sell tomorrow morning. Do they buy fewer, knowing that they'll sell out\u2013and then miss out on potential revenue from papers not sold? Or do they order more than they expect to sell, just in case\u2013and eat the cost of a few unsold papers? This type of trade-off applies to all kinds of businesses, and Gallino talks us through how to choose.\nThe only certainty in this life is uncertainty.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Twins are used to fielding all sorts of questions, like \"Can you read each other's minds?\" or \"Can you feel each other's pain?\" Two of our Planet Money reporters are twins, and they have heard them all.\nBut it's not just strangers on the street who are fascinated by twins. Scientists have been studying twins since the 1800s, trying to get at one of humanity's biggest questions: How much of what we do and how we are is encoded in our genes? The answer to this has all kinds of implications, for everything from healthcare to education, criminal justice and government spending.\nToday on the show, we look at the history of twin studies. We ask what decades of studying twins has taught us. We look back at a twin study that asked whether genes influence antisocial behavior and rule-breaking. One of our reporters was a subject in it. And we find out: are twin studies still important for science?\n(Note: This episode originally ran in 2019.)\n\nOur show today was hosted by Sally Helm and Karen Duffin.

Though machines have transformed industries like agriculture and manufacturing, the conventional wisdom was that they could never perform what's called \"knowledge work.\" That the robots could never replace lawyers or accountants \u2014 or journalists, like us.<br/><br/>Well, ever since the release of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, it feels like no job is safe. AI can now write essays, generate computer code, and even pass the bar exam. Will work ever be the same again?<br/><br/>Here at Planet Money, we are launching a new three-part series to understand what this new AI-powered future looks like. Our goal: to get the machines to make an entire Planet Money show. <br/><br/>In this first episode, we try to teach the AI how to write a script for us from scratch. Can the AI do research for us, interview our sources, and then stitch everything together in a creative, entertaining way? We're going to find out just how much of our own jobs we can automate \u2014 and what work might soon look like for us all.<br/><br/>(And, in case you're wondering... this text was not written by an AI.)<br/><br/><em>This episode was produced by Emma Peaslee and Willa Rubin.

The amount they paid seemed too high. Eventually, her curiosity about that observation spawned a whole area of study.\nThis episode is a collaboration with NPR's Code Switch podcast. Host Gene Demby spoke to Dorothy Brown about how race and taxes play out in marriage, housing, and student debt.\nThis episode was produced by James Sneed, with help from Olivia Chilkoti.

Then, in the span of just a few days, it collapsed. Whispers that SVB might be in trouble spread like wildfire through group texts and Twitter posts.

            "contentSnippet": "The 90s sit-com Seinfeld is often called \"a show about nothing.\" Lauded for its observational humor, this quick-witted show focussed on four hapless New Yorkers navigating work, relationships...yada yada yada.\nJerry, George, Elaine & Kramer set themselves apart from the characters who populated shows like Friends or Cheers, by being the exact opposite of the characters audiences would normally root for. These four New Yorkers were overly analytical, calculating, and above all, selfish.\nIn other words, they had all the makings of a fascinating case study in economics.\nEconomics professors Linda Ghent and Alan Grant went so far as to write an entire book on the subject, Seinfeld & Economics. The book points readers to economic principles that appear throughout the show, ideas like economic utility, game theory, and the best way to allocate resources in the face of scarcity.\nOn today's show, we make the case that Seinfeld is, at its heart, not a show about nothing, but a show about economics. And that understanding Seinfeld can change the way you understand economics itself.\nThis episode was produced by Alyssa Jeong Perry with help from Emma Peaslee. It was edited by Keith Romer. It was mastered by Robert Rodriguez and fact-checked by Sierra Juarez.
