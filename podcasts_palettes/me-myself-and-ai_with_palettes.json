She also addresses the complexities of integrating AI into the workforce and the misleading narrative around the inevitability of AI taking over humans\u2019 jobs. She advocates for a proactive approach to adopting the technology instead, where organizations, policy makers, and workers collaborate to that ensure AI enhances jobs rather than eliminating them. Read the episode transcript here.\nGuest bio\nRebecca Finlay is CEO at Partnership on AI (PAI), a global nonprofit that brings together a cross-sector community of over 100 partners in 17 countries to ensure that developments in artificial intelligence advance positive outcomes for people and society. Working at the intersection of technology and society, Finlay has held leadership roles in civil society, research organizations, and industry.\nBefore joining PAI, she founded global research organization CIFAR\u2019s AI & Society program, one of the first international multi-stakeholder initiatives on the impact of AI in society. Her insights have been featured in books and the media, including the Financial Times, The Guardian, Politico, and Nature Machine Intelligence. She has spoken at venues such as South by Southwest and the U.K. AI Safety Summit.\nFinlay is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences and sits on advisory bodies in Canada, France, and the U.S. She holds degrees from McGill University and the University of Cambridge.\nMe, Myself, and AI\u00a0is a collaborative podcast from\u00a0MIT Sloan Management Review\u00a0and Boston Consulting Group and is hosted by Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh.

He rightfully predicted that technology would blow up as an economic driver coming out of the inflation of the 1970s but acknowledges he did not foresee the inequality that technology advances would lead to.\nOn this episode, Paul shares his views on AI advances and their implications for society. Rather than pave the way for full automation, he is a proponent of keeping humans in the loop and believes that, rather than slowing down technology, it can be pointed in a direction for more meaningful and beneficial use, citing education as an area ripe to benefit from AI.

She also discusses how NASA\u2019s use of AI \u2014 and its approach to risk \u2014 offer lessons for organizations that are looking to simulate real-world scenarios here on Earth.

She also serves as chief engineer of robotic operations for the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover. She was previously the assistant section manager of the Mobility & Robotics section, the supervisor of the section staff group, and the supervisor of the Operable Robotics Group.\nVerma works on new robotics capabilities, including R&D; mission design; prototyping; flight development, testing, and launch; and landing and surface operations. She has been engaged in robotic operations on Mars since 2008 with the Mars Exploration Rover mission's Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity rover, Perseverance rover, and Ingenuity helicopter.\nBefore joining JPL, she led the NASA Ames Research Center team that developed PLEXIL (Plan Execution Interchange Language) for operating autonomous systems, as well as the development of technology that has been deployed on rovers and human spaceflight projects.\nVerma earned a Ph.D. in robotics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2005.\nWe encourage you to rate and review our show.

                    "description": "When Zan Gilani came to the U.S. from Pakistan to complete his undergraduate studies, he chose to study Chinese because it was rumored to be a difficult language. At the time, the tech industry was booming, and he quickly became interested in applying his passion for foreign languages and learning more generally in a technology-rich environment.\nThose interests led Zan to Duolingo, where he has been working in product management for eight years and now oversees the app company\u2019s experiential AI team. What excites him about working at the language-learning app company is his ability to help build solutions that enable personalized education at scale: The app boasts over 16 million daily active users, and AI-driven functionality motivates them through frequent notifications, personalizes learning experiences by adjusting the difficulty of questions in practice sessions, and observes and critiques learners\u2019 performance.\nZan joins our podcast to outline the specific ways Duolingo uses AI and machine learning to drive user engagement, and discuss how the technology can be used to support learning more generally.

CCT approaches its work by first considering what problems it\u2019s trying to solve, developing use cases, and then considering whether a technology solution might be the best way forward.\nIn this episode, we learn how a combination of Ranjeet\u2019s background in chemical engineering,\u00a0his experience working in the health care space, and a holistic approach to leadership and problem-solving enable him to lead CCT to constantly innovate in the supply chain space. Ranjeet also discusses the benefits of a customer-first mindset and shares insights applicable to leaders in industries beyond health care.
