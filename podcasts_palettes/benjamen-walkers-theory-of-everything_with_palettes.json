It\u2019s always bothered Leo Rubinfien that\u00a0his friend Garry\u2019s legacy is bound up with these hard to find books, for leo a much better way to appreciate the genius of Garry Winogrand is through his slideshows. Recently\u00a0Leo Rubinfien\u00a0got an opportunity to show the world the Garry Winogrand he knew and loved,\u00a0 SFMOMA \u00a0invited him to guest curate a Winogrand show. The exhibit \u00a0took years\u00a0to put together, and at the outset SFMOMA\u2019s\u00a0assistant curator of photography <a href=\"http://www.sfmoma.org/about/press/press_exhibitions/releases/920\" target=\"_blank\">Erin O\u2019toole</a> was nervous, but she tells us why she is now in the cult of Winogrand too. \u00a0While your host was in Australia this summer he met up with one of his new favorite artists, the cartoonist <a href=\"http://girlmountain.tumblr.com/post/85821182607/excerpt-from-the-jobs-section-of-life-zone\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Hanselmann</a>. Simon is one of the most compelling voices of his generation, but while\u00a0his characters are all sex, drugs, and rock and roll Simon just works. Also we reminisce about the early days of the web with ToE regular Peter Choyce who believes he had one of the first ten blogs. Three reminders\u00a0that being\u00a0an artist will always be hard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0",
