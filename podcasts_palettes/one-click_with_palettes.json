This series explores how a single click can change a life forever. This season, One Click tells the story of DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol), an explosive chemical originally used in WWI-era munitions factories that found a home on the internet as a diet pill and has left hundreds dead in its wake. Together, actress Elle Fanning and journalist Jessica Wapner, trace the history of DNP and reckon with the question of why. Through the story of DNP and its victims, we encounter issues of body image and mental health as the series unravels the chain of events that could lead to one fatal decision.\n\n \n\n \n\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n\n \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
