Today we're sharing an episode from Good Sport, a show that dives into worlds like F1 racing, table tennis, NBA shooting, and beyond to shed a light on the ups and downs of being human.</p><p>If a sport isn't thinking about how to entertain its fans, it usually doesn't last long. And with so much competing for our attention, what makes someone follow a specific team, or show up to a game? In this episode we look to two exploding fanbases: Formula One Racing and \u2026 Banana Ball? Jody speaks with Jessica Smetana and Spencer Hall, the co-hosts of the Formula One podcast \u201cDNF\u201d, about what Netflix has to do with F1\u2019s success. Then Jody talks to Jesse Cole, the owner of The Savannah Bananas, a baseball team that\u2019s selling out games and gaining millions of followers on TikTok \u2013 at the same time Major League Baseball continues to bleed fans. Jessie\u2019s approach to cultivating a \u201cfans first, entertainment always\u201d mentality is literally reinventing how we play and think about sports.

Today: in celebration of Mother's Day , we're sharing an episode we think you'll enjoy from How to Be a Better Human.</p><p>Activist, and MacArthur Genuis, Ai-jen Poo believes that caring for others is one of the fundamental acts that make us human. But from nannies to elder-care workers, house cleaners to living assistants, single parents and beyond, globally, caretakers do not earn fair wages or recognition for their essential, life-giving labor. The President of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, Ai-jen explains how society undervalues domestic work, and provides a framework on how we can start a conversation about the future of care for our loved ones \u2013 and ourselves.
