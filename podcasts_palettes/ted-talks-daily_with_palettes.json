Lupi invites us to consider data not as a rigid or objective truth, but as a living language used to better understand ourselves, offering a surprising shift in perspective \u2014 depending on where you look.</p>",

Back for a new season, Head of TED Chris Anderson interviews amazing thinkers about the ultimate idea worth spreading: infectious generosity.</p><p>Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and the co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, is one of the top ten richest people in the world. But since 2008, he has traded his day-to-day role with Microsoft to focus full-time on his foundation's work to expand opportunity around the world.</p><p>Chris interviews Bill about his philanthropy philosophy and digs into the opportunities and challenges that face one of the largest private charitable foundations in the world. The two also discuss The Giving Pledge, the movement Bill co-founded with Warren Buffet, which encourages wealthy individuals to commit the majority of their wealth to charitable causes within their lifetimes.</p><p>Chris and Bill examine the importance of solving the world\u2019s most pressing problems efficiently, talk about why meaningful change requires scale, and compare notes on how to best encourage collective excitement about giving back.</p>",

This stage of life is called menopause, and it makes humans an evolutionary wonder! But our perception of it has been shaped by centuries of stigma and shame\u2014up until recently it was even considered a \"disease\" by the medical establishment that needed to be cured. Menopause isn't a disease, but that doesn't mean it's a party either. There can be troublesome symptoms for many people. So you might be thinking, \"I'm not in menopause now\" or \"I'm not going to go through menopause, ever. Why should I care?\" Dr. Jen tells us why while taking us through the complex history of how we got here, giving hot tips on managing hot flashes, and sharing why menopause shouldn't be viewed as the end of the race, but a victory lap.\u00a0 You can read the text transcript for this episode at go.ted.com/BodyStuffTranscript3.

This stage of life is called menopause, and it makes humans an evolutionary wonder! But our perception of it has been shaped by centuries of stigma and shame\u2014up until recently it was even considered a \"disease\" by the medical establishment that needed to be cured. Menopause isn't a disease, but that doesn't mean it's a party either. There can be troublesome symptoms for many people. So you might be thinking, \"I'm not in menopause now\" or \"I'm not going to go through menopause, ever. Why should I care?\" Dr. Jen tells us why while taking us through the complex history of how we got here, giving hot tips on managing hot flashes, and sharing why menopause shouldn't be viewed as the end of the race, but a victory lap.\u00a0 You can read the text transcript for this episode at go.ted.com/BodyStuffTranscript3.
