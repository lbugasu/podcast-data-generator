In this mind-bending talk, science writer Anil Ananthaswamy shares how the experiences of \"altered selves\" -- resulting from schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, foreign limb syndrome or other conditions -- shed light on the constructed nature of identity. He breaks down where our sense of self comes from and invites us to challenge our assumptions about who we are, with the aim of building a better you and a better world.</p>",
