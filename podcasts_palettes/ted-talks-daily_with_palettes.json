He also explores the push for phone bans in schools and the concrete steps we can take to improve the mental health of young people around the world.

In this timely conversation, he investigates how a smartphone-based childhood, amplified by overprotective parenting, is driving the mental health crisis among young people. He also explores the push for phone bans in schools and the concrete steps we can take to improve the mental health of young people around the world.
