This stage of life is called menopause, and it makes humans an evolutionary wonder! But our perception of it has been shaped by centuries of stigma and shame\u2014up until recently it was even considered a \"disease\" by the medical establishment that needed to be cured. Menopause isn't a disease, but that doesn't mean it's a party either. There can be troublesome symptoms for many people.\u00a0So you might be thinking, \"I'm not in menopause now\" or \"I'm not going to go through menopause, ever. Why should I care?\" Dr. Jen tells us why while taking us through the complex history of how we got here, giving hot tips on managing hot flashes, and sharing why menopause shouldn't be viewed as the end of the race, but a victory lap. \u00a0You can read the text transcript for this episode at\u00a0go.ted.com/BodyStuffTranscript3.
