Pastor Steven Furtick of Elevation Church in Charlotte, NC is helping us keep our minds safe from fear, frustration, and even an unhealthy obsession with \u201d\u2018the facts.\u201d\u2019 He says, \u201cWe need medical masks for our minds,\u201d so we can \u201cFocus On The Fruit.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis message was built from two key Bible passages, Philippians 1:12-22 written by the Apostle Paul while he was in prison and Romans 8:18-28.\r\n\r\nRomans 8:28 says, \u201cAnd we know that is all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to His purpose.\u201d Even if we feel like we\u2019ve been given a prison sentence in this season, we can choose to focus on the word of God, we can choose to turn graves Into gardens.\r\n\r\nWhen you watch this message, you\u2019ll learn how to shift your mind to the only thing you really can control \u2014, what you choose to focus on.
