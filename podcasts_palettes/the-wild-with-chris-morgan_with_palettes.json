The heat that builds beneath Death Valley\u2019s cloudless skies radiates off barren rocks and sinks into the valley bottoms, where it warms, baking everything it touches and evaporates any water foolish enough to linger at the surface.</p> <p>But beneath miles of dry desert land - in the largest national park in the lower 48 - is something you can't see from the crusty surface. A secret watery world, hidden underground. And a cave system that is home to the world\u2019s rarest fish. The Devil\u2019s Hole pupfish is less than an inch long, but has caused quite a stir.</p> <p>In this episode of THE WILD, Chris travels to Death Valley National Park to learn about how this tiny fish has made history and has changed our understanding of desert water in some remarkable ways.</p> <p><em>This show would not be possible without listener support.

                    "description": "<p>Chris joins a team of scuba divers...in the desert!\u00a0</p> <p>Death Valley National Park is the hottest place on Earth and the driest place in North America. The heat that builds beneath Death Valley\u2019s cloudless skies radiates off barren rocks and sinks into the valley bottoms, where it warms, baking everything it touches and evaporates any water foolish enough to linger at the surface.</p> <p>But beneath miles of dry desert land - in the largest national park in the lower 48 - is something you can't see from the crusty surface. A secret watery world, hidden underground. And a cave system that is home to the world\u2019s rarest fish. The Devil\u2019s Hole pupfish is less than an inch long, but has caused quite a stir.</p> <p>In this episode of THE WILD, Chris travels to Death Valley National Park to learn about how this tiny fish has made history and has changed our understanding of desert water in some remarkable ways.</p> <p><em>This show would not be possible without listener support.

                    "description": "<p>It is safe to say that Americans love their cars. The mythology of the open road speaks to us all, calling us for adventure. But American wildlife might have something else to say about that. One million animals are killed on roads every day but the problem with our transportation system goes beyond roadkill.</p> <p>Environmental journalist Ben Goldfarb says practically everything in the natural world is influenced by all these miles of gravel and tarmac. His latest book is \u201cCrossings: How Road Ecology is Shaping the Future of our Planet.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p>Enjoy this fascinating conversation with an author who traveled the world for answers about roads. Those roads take us to stories about cougars, butterflies, deer, and of course bears.\u00a0</p> <p>This show would not be possible without listener support.

I met a guy named Dan Olsen, who records killer whale calls using an underwater hydrophone.&nbsp;</p><p>Olsen gets all kinds of information from his recordings. The calls bring the underwater world of orcas alive. But there's a lot more going on in these clicks and whistles than you might think. Like, how their dialects, their languages, evolve, and even become part of orca family \"culture.\u201d</p><p>Jay Julius, a member of the Lummi Nation, says there's something deeper going on in the conversations among orca pods in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>The orca story is one of human misunderstanding and generational trauma. But it's also a story of celebration, family, and a sense of place. Exploring their chatty underwater world might just help us understand how they are communicating\u2026 and what they are trying to say.</p><p>Follow us on Instagram @thewildpod and @chrismorganwildlife</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",

At the side of the road was a sign that grabbed my attention. About a storied fire lookout cabin on top of Desolation Peak in the distance, where author Jack Kerouac spent some time in the 50s. The irony was that I couldn\u2019t see the peak because of the forest fire smoke in the air that day. But it fired my imagination\u2026.the mountain was calling me. This episode of THE WILD is the result.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The American west is a fire landscape. Since 1983, there\u2019s been an average of 70,000 wildfires every year in the United States. And the wildfire season is getting longer. Warmer springs and long dry summers are the cause.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Things are changing fast in this ancient landscape\u2026So how have wildfires and our philosophy of fighting them changed over the decades?</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">To answer that, I\u2019ve climbed to the top of this mountain, to the famed fire lookout at Desolation Peak, to speak to Jim Henterly. He is the fire watchman who\u2019s stationed at the lookout. Desolation Peak has long been a place to look for answers. I\u2019m hoping to find a new perspective through him.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The job of a fire lookout is to be a step ahead, ever watchful - observe all around you - and warn of danger. But maybe also to remind us of our role in the ever evolving ecology of fire.</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The WILD is a joint production of myself and KUOW Public Radio.

This episode of THE WILD is the result.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The American west is a fire landscape. Since 1983, there\u2019s been an average of 70,000 wildfires every year in the United States. And the wildfire season is getting longer. Warmer springs and long dry summers are the cause.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Things are changing fast in this ancient landscape\u2026So how have wildfires and our philosophy of fighting them changed over the decades?</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">To answer that, I\u2019ve climbed to the top of this mountain, to the famed fire lookout at Desolation Peak, to speak to Jim Henterly. He is the fire watchman who\u2019s stationed at the lookout. Desolation Peak has long been a place to look for answers. I\u2019m hoping to find a new perspective through him.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The job of a fire lookout is to be a step ahead, ever watchful - observe all around you - and warn of danger. But maybe also to remind us of our role in the ever evolving ecology of fire.</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The WILD is a joint production of myself and KUOW Public Radio.

                    "description": "I hope you're enjoying spring wherever you are. I just wanted to let you know that we're taking a short break to work on some new episodes. We just got back from an incredible trip in California for two stories. One is about California condors, North America's biggest bird that almost became extinct and island foxes on the Channel Islands. We'll be back in June, which means that now is the perfect time to listen to past episodes if you missed them.

It\u2019s one of the most bio-diverse places on the planet.

Spring is only a few weeks away (March 20) and it\u2019s the time that beavers become more active, after laying low during the long winter.
