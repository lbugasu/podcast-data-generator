It walked inside the front door, right into a fast food restaurant full of people. And then, it sat in a soda cooler for an hour. It was an event so rare, it made the evening news.&nbsp;</p><p>Why did the coyote walk into the Quiznos? How was it so tolerant of people? It's not normal for a wild animal to be less than six feet away from a human without a care.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes you start to think about a story that you want to tell, but the story itself takes you to unexpected places \u2026 in this case to some of the biggest questions of our time about urban ecology, race, and our future relationship with nature.

So David is on a rescue mission to save the burrowing owl.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">This rescue mission involves some chemical weapons, an old military base, and a very large plunger.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">It\u2019s a story about one man\u2019s love affair with a mysterious little creature, and the things they\u2019ve taught him about what they need to survive.</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The WILD is a joint production of myself and KUOW Public Radio.

            "contentSnippet": "I hope you are having a lovely summer so far. Or winter if you\u2019re south of the equator. THE WILD team is busy working on episodes for the next season. But I wanted to share something special with you that I think you\u2019ll like. This is an episode from the podcast Living Planet from Deutsche Welle. They tell environment stories from around the world. In this episode they explore efforts to bring life back to seabeds off the coast of Scotland. They also look at an app that can tell what species a frog is by its song. A sort of Shazam for amphibians. \nYou can learn more about the Living Planet podcast here.\nTHE WILD is a joint production of myself and KUOW Public Radio. One way to support this vital work and become part of THE WILD community is through my wildlife organization, Chris Morgan Wildlife. You can find more information at Patreon.\nFollow THE WILD with Chris Morgan on Instagram @thewildpod and @chrismorganwildlife\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
