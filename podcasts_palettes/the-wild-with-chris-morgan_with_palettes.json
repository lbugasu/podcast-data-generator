On April 25, 2024 that dream has taken a massive step towards becoming reality. The National Park Service and U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service have announced that they will be restoring the grizzly population that called this place home for thousands of years. They were a key part of this ecosystem before they were basically eliminated by humans, so this is their chance to roam these mountains again. The plan is to bring 3-7 grizzly bears in per year for a few years to reach an initial population of twenty-five bears. It\u2019s a big milestone.\u00a0</p> <p>How we got here is a long and fascinating story. Which is why I wanted to share an episode that we did for THE WILD back in 2019. <em>The 'Ghost Bears' of Washington</em>. I hope it\u2019ll give you a little more understanding about grizzlies, the rollercoaster ride it\u2019s been here in the North Cascades, and what it will mean to have them back. Hope you enjoy!</p> <p>And if you want to learn more about grizzlies here are links to two short films on the topic that we made a few years ago that have been really popular.

It was an event so rare, it made the evening news.\u00a0\nWhy did the coyote walk into the Quiznos? How was it so tolerant of people? It's not normal for a wild animal to be less than six feet away from a human without a care.\u00a0\nSometimes you start to think about a story that you want to tell, but the story itself takes you to unexpected places \u2026 in this case to some of the biggest questions of our time about urban ecology, race, and our future relationship with nature. This is one of those stories.\nToday, we\u2019ll look at how a coyote in a refrigerator can teach us to rethink our entire relationship with nature: from deep in the wilderness, to deep downtown in our cities.\nClarification, 2:30 p.m., 6/6/2023: Sam Kreling is a PhD student working with Laura Prugh, Associate Professor of Quantitative Wildlife Sciences at the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences at the University of Washington. Professor Prugh is the principal investigator of the Seattle Coyote Project.\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

At the side of the road was a sign that grabbed my attention. About a storied fire lookout cabin on top of Desolation Peak in the distance, where author Jack Kerouac spent some time in the 50s. The irony was that I couldn\u2019t see the peak because of the forest fire smoke in the air that day. But it fired my imagination\u2026.the mountain was calling me. This episode of THE WILD is the result.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The American west is a fire landscape. Since 1983, there\u2019s been an average of 70,000 wildfires every year in the United States. And the wildfire season is getting longer.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Kick back for a spot of British birdwatching as I head into the English countryside with twitcher Lee Evans. Lee is an extreme birder and he\u2019s become notorious in a nation of bird-lovers, as the man who\u2019ll go to any lengths to fulfill his bird obsession. \nLee has driven 2.2 million miles around the UK and Ireland looking for birds. So far he\u2019s seen 594 different species, but not without some mishaps. I join him for a day in the field to hear more, and to tap into the mind of a really fascinating and knowledgeable man.
