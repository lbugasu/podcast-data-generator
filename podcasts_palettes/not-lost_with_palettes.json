    "description": "<p>When both his popular culture podcast and long-term relationship come to an end, journalist Brendan finds he has the time \u2014 and freedom \u2014 to pursue his dream: a travel podcast where he goes places and learns about them by getting invited to a stranger\u2019s house for dinner. A friend joins him at each destination and they drink, dance, and eat their way from Montr\u00e9al to Mexico City, often learning as much about themselves as the place they\u2019re visiting. Not Lost is both a delightful travel escape and an insightful look at people \u2014 locals and visitors alike \u2014 trying to make sense of a constantly changing world.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><em>Not Lost is a co-production of Pushkin Industries, Topic Studios and iHeartMedia. </em><em>iHeartMedia is the exclusive podcast partner of Pushkin Industries.</em></p>",

A friend joins him at each destination and they drink, dance, and eat their way from Montr\u00e9al to Mexico City, often learning as much about themselves as the place they\u2019re visiting. Not Lost is both a delightful travel escape and an insightful look at people \u2014 locals and visitors alike \u2014 trying to make sense of a constantly changing world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot Lost is a co-production of Pushkin Industries, Topic Studios and iHeartMedia. iHeartMedia is the exclusive podcast partner of Pushkin Industries."
