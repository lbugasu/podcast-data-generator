Just like the Israelites, we can fall into the sin of adultery in three ways: distrusting God, not sharing in God's purpose and forgetting God's faithfulness. Even though we still break His covenant today, God has paved a path of mercy and restoration for us through the life of Jesus and the price He paid on the cross."
