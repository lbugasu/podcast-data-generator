In this episode, we hear from several listeners with common questions and concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines. Questions like: Where can I get vaccinated? Should I get the vaccine if I have underlying health conditions? What if I\u2019m breastfeeding? How do I manage my anxiety about getting vaccinated?</p><p><br></p><p>Zahra first consults with epidemiologist and SELF contributor Tara Smith, Ph.D., who takes us through how the vaccine works, why the vast majority of side effects are nothing to worry about, and what you need to know before getting the vaccine. Zahra then talks to SELF\u2019s associate news director, Sarah Jacoby, who has been covering the pandemic and the vaccines extensively. Sarah shares her experience getting her COVID-19 vaccine as well as a glimpse of what life post-vaccination might look like.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>To connect with Dr. Smith and Sarah, you can follow them on Twitter @aetiology and @sarah_jacoby, respectively, and read their work for SELF <a href=\"https://www.self.com/contributor/tara-smith\">here</a> (<a href=\"https://www.self.com/contributor/tara-smith\">https://www.self.com/contributor/tara-smith</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.self.com/contributor/sarah-jacoby\">here</a> (<a href=\"https://www.self.com/contributor/sarah-jacoby\">https://www.self.com/contributor/sarah-jacoby</a>).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Zahra mentions a March 2021 survey about there being little difference in vaccine hesitancy between Black and white Americans. You can find more information on that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/12/976172586/little-difference-in-vaccine-hesitancy-among-white-and-black-americans-poll-find\">here</a> (https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/12/976172586/little-difference-in-vaccine-hesitancy-among-white-and-black-americans-poll-find).
