Every romantic comedy has the down-on-her-luck best friend. Every action movie has the badass one-liners. Every Oscar-bait drama has that tear-jerker ending.</p><br><p>But where do those tropes come from? How do audiences become so aware of Hollywood's bag of tricks, parody movies can become a massive genre on their own?</p><br><p>This series explores the birth, death, and rebirth of one of the most successful cinematic genres ever: the rockstar biopic. In this episode, we start from the beginning, focusing on the earliest established tropes of the genre.</p><br><p>Lady Sings the Blues, The Buddy Holly Story, and 8 Mile.</p><br><p>The first episode is available now in this feed and the reminder of the season is ready to binge on the Don't Explain feed on all podcast platforms. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
