We're sharing stories from people who did just that, by making the decision to confront the difficulties and divides in their own lives head on; those who chose to seek connection when the opposite path seemed easier or sometimes even more logical. These stories aren't about finding an easy solution, they're about dealing with the reality of the world, and trying to make the best of it.<br/><br/><em>If you want to leave the StoryCorps Podcast a voicemail, call us at 702-706-TALK.
