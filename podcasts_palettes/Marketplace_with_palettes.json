But some renters there are still facing eviction, and many have found it difficult to access county- and state-level COVID relief funds. As the federal government works to reallocate rent relief, we pay a visit to Montgomery County to see how officials, activists and renters are responding. But first, a look at what 2022 might bring for the job market, how restaurants and bars are planning for a second New Year&#8217;s Eve with COVID and why a big-ticket bailout for the U.K.&#8217;s hospitality industry still might only be a drop in the bucket.</p>\n"
