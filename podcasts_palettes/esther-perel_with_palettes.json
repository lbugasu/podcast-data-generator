They spring from different sources and pull us in different directions. And the issue today is that we want to reconcile this tension in our romantic relationships and in many other facets of our lives.\n\nControl, for many, means choosing one or the other: security or freedom. The fact is we need both. Because we desire the security of belonging\u2014whether to a person, a job, or a community\u2014and the freedom to explore other options, we often find ourselves acting out of our internal contradictions.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve observed is this: people want partnership and a deep lasting love, but they also want relationships that should also be revocable at any time. So, let me ask you: at this very moment, do you crave a foundation or wings?\n\nFor more on this topic, read my newsletter linked below: \n\nhttps://bit.ly/3m81MTQ",

On a global level, the stakes seem impossibly high. But how about in your bedroom, or living room? Can we as therapists, coaches, relieve men's suffering - both individual symptoms and interpersonal difficulties - by helping them reconstruct who they are as men, what kind of man to be? Throw \"neutrality\" out the window and heal men by empowering them to move beyond the constricted hand that was dealt to them.\n\nDoug Braun-Harvey\nWhat I Have Learned Listening to Men Describe Their Erotic Orientation\n\nMany men feel shame at the thought of revealing their most precious and vital source of erotic and sexual pleasure. Shame may obstruct the formations of an integrated erotic identity development. Shame does not extinguish sexual and erotic desire.  Psychotherapy cannot perform erotic-ectomies.  Shame avoidance becomes a masculine strategy for living with an erotic conflict.  \nHow do men explore their erotic orientation without slipping into judgments and narratives that enforce masculinity upon the erotic?\nIs erotic literacy a masculinity transgression?\nIs a sexual behavior disease/label the solution for men to find empathy for their erotic diversity that transgresses masculine scripts?\n\nErlanger Turner\nAddressing Masculinities and Cultural Expectations in Therapy\n\nDr. Turner will discuss masculinity norms and how they pose challenges for engaging men in therapy. He will also discuss the research on how culture influences expectations in therapy. Finally, he will conclude with discussing practical advice on engaging men in individual and couples therapy.\n\n--\n\nSessions Live is an annual event hosted by Esther Perel for therapists and coaches.
