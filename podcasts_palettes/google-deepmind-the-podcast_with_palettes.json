Beyond helping us communicate ideas, language plays a crucial role in memory, cooperation, and thinking \u2013 which is why AI researchers have long aimed to communicate with computers using natural language. Recently, there has been extraordinary progress using large-language models (LLM), which learn how to speak by processing huge amounts of data from the internet.
