The son of Peleus, a Greek King, and Thetis, a divine sea nymph, Achilles was a demigod with extraordinary strength and courage. The perfect combination to make a great warrior, he is perhaps best known from Homer's epic poem the Iliad, which details his adventures in the final year of the Trojan War.</p><br><p>He's also gone down in history for his passionate love for his companion, Patroclus. Sources and mythology differ was to the nature of their relationship, and in this episode, we ask the question: was it really erotic? What do the sources say? Does our definition of love differ to that of the Ancient Greeks? And how did it inspire one of the greatest military generals in history: Alexander of Macedon?</p><br><p>To help explore these themes, host Tristan Hughes is joined by returning guest Professor Alastair Blanshard from University of Queensland.</p><br><p>Voiceover: Lucy Davidson</p><p>Script Writer: Andrew Hulse</p><p>Editor: Aidan Lonergan</p><p>Assistant Producer: Annie Coloe</p><p>Senior Producer: Elena Guthrie</p><br><p><strong>Discover the past on History Hit with ad-free original podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians like Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Matt Lewis, Tristan Hughes and more.

He's one of the most complex figures in history, and his story is one that's been retold throughout millennia.

            "content": "<p>In January 330 BC, Alexander the Great faced one of his most difficult challenges to date. A small Persian force, entrenched in a formidable defensive position that blockaded Alexander\u2019s route to the Persian heartlands. A narrow pass through the Zagros Mountains that has gone down in history as the Persian, or Susian, Gates. Although nowhere near the size or scale of Alexander\u2019s previous pitched battles against the Persians at the Granicus, Issus and Gaugamela, this clash in the mountains deserves its moment in the spotlight.

Emerging from the tumultuous \u2018Successor Wars\u2019 that followed Alexander the Great\u2019s passing, for over a century it was a superpower of the eastern Mediterranean. This, however, ultimately led it into conflict with Rome at the beginning of the 2nd century BC. The result was a devastating defeat for the Seleucid King Antiochus III \u2018the Great\u2019 at the Battle of Magnesia, fought around this time of year in either December 190 BC or January 189 BC. Following the battle, the Seleucids were humbled by a damaging treaty, but what happened next? What followed for the Seleucids, having been humbled by the Romans? Did they descend from superpower to suppliant? Or did they experience a resurgence?

                "summary": "When one mentions Roman military installations you would be forgiven for instantly thinking of their forts, the remains of which we can see today dotted around the country. From the Kent coast to central Scotland. But what about their camps, these often-temporary structures that formed a keystone of Roman military activity. Roman camps have now been discovered across the former empire, but Britain boasts a wealth of them. To discuss the different types of camps and how we can tell them apart, Tristan spoke to Dr Rebecca Jones from Historic Environment Scotland. Rebecca explains why Scotland in particular is the best place to study marching camps, and why there is such a concentration of them on the Roman Empire\u2019s northernmost frontier. Rebecca is the author of \u2018Roman Camps in Britain\u2019."

                "summary": "He was one of the greatest rebels of Rome from the 1st century AD, but his name is not one you might initially think of. Derided by Roman historians as being little more than a bandit, the truth is very much the opposite. For several years, between 17 and 24 AD, Tacfarinas led a revolt against the Romans in North Africa, sending the province into turmoil and becoming the bane of all troops stationed there to fight him. Several times the Romans believed they defeated Tacfarinas and his Berber followers. Several times they were proved wrong as time after time Tacfarinas emerged from the desert with a new force to wreak havoc on wealthy North Africa. For too long, Tacfarinas\u2019 name has been side-lined in favour of more famous 1st century AD Roman rebels such as Boudica, Arminius and Caratacus. Now we\u2019re going to right that wrong. Joining Tristan on today\u2019s podcast is Dr Jo Ball, an Ancients veteran having been on the show twice before. Together Tristan and Jo talk through the incredible story of Tacfarinas and why he really was \u2018the Desert Hydra.\u2019"

Stay tuned for a follow up podcast in due course with Lloyd on the other Achaemenid urban centres! Lloyd is the author of 'Persians: The Age of the Great Kings', out in 2022."

The images, which include carvings of two red deer, were found by chance on an ancient burial site in Argyll, called Dunchraigaig Cairn. Dr Tertia Barnett, principle investigator for Scotland\u2019s Rock Art Project at Historic Environment Scotland, is on The Ancients to explain why this incredible new discovery is so significant. Find out what the carvings might mean, how they have been conserved for thousands of years, and why these images rewrite the story of prehistoric rock art in north-west Europe."

But what was life like for the first people to venture between Hawaii, New Zealand and Easter Island, to name a few? In this episode Christina Thompson explores the new evidence which can tell us more about what the ancient Polynesians ate and how they lived. From the DNA of ancient rats to the mystery of the sweet potato, this is an intriguing listen. Christina is the author of \u2018Sea People: The Puzzle of Polynesia\u2019."

They have been portrayed as a savage people, who contributed little to world history. But is this really the case? In this podcast, Tristan was joined by Professor Hyun Jin Kim to talk about the emergence of the Huns in the west in the late 4th century, and the striking geopolitical changes that their rapid expansion brought about. Hyun Jin dismantles the portrayal that all the Huns did was destroy and plunder and highlights the remarkable structure of this ancient empire.

From papyri fragments to inscriptions to ostraca to rare coinage. Part 2, focused around Petra's later ancient history, will be released soon!</p>"

If we believe the numbers given in Cassius Dio, this was the greatest and bloodiest clash between two Roman armies in history. 300,000 soldiers were present in total, according to Dio. The numbers are debated, but nevertheless the titanic scale of this clash in ancient history is clear to see. In this episode Tristan speaks to Dr Jonathan Eaton about the lead up to the battle, how Severus and Albinus went from friends to foes, and whether we can really call this the biggest battle in Roman history. Jonathan is Academic Registrar at Teeside University and author of \u2018Leading The Roman Army: Soldiers and Emperors 31 BC - 235 AD\u2019.",

Though not a household name as the others may be, Tomyris\u2019 story contains all of the hallmarks of an epic. Tomyris was Queen of the Massagetae people, from present day Central Asia, in the 6th century BC. She is remembered in Herodotus\u2019 first book for her vengeful challenge to the bloodthirsty Cyrus the Great. To talk about Tomyris, Queen and commander, Tristan was joined by Christian Djurslev of Aarhus University."

This might not be the case were the holiday not to fall on 25 December and, although many things have been missed in 2020, the usual questions of whether this is the right date arrived reliably on time. So, for this episode, Tristan spoke to Professor Matthew McCarty to find out whether Christmas Day was really placed in December to supplant non-Christian worship, in particular that of Mithras. Matthew is Assistant Professor of Roman Archaeology at the University of British Columbia. He has been directing the field excavation of a mithraeum in Apulum (Romania), the first scientifically excavated mithraeum in the province of Dacia. In this festive episode, he shares his insight into the social dynamics of ritual practices in the sanctuary at Apulum and elsewhere."

Simon Elliott is an archaeologist, historian and broadcaster. He came onto the podcast to talk to Tristan about 7,500 years of history - in under an hour. Using the Bible as a jumping off point, Simon takes us through the technological developments and innovation of warfare, bringing in other archaeological findings to support the singular perspective of the bible. This episode runs through the first walled settlement at Jericho, the first battle chariots and the development of different strategies. This truly is a who\u2019s who of the Ancients, including the Assyrians, Babylonians, Sumerians, Akkadians, Egyptians of all kingdoms, Hittites, Sea Peoples, Philistines and Hebrews."

The grapes of Pompeii may have ended up on the tables of the house at which they were grown; they might have been made into low quality wine for manual workers or better quality wine valued at more than the wages of many; or, they might have been shipped far and wide.</p><br><p>Emlyn Dodd is a Fellow at the Australian Archaeological Institute in Athens and is currently directing a survey project across Cycladic islands which, among other things, is investigating the production of wine and oil in the Classical to Late Antique eras. He spoke to Tristan about what the evidence from Pompeii tells us about grape growth and wine production there, and whether this can be scaled out to other settlements in the Roman Mediterranean.</p>"

She also answered the all important question: did the Ancients send elephants into battle drunk?</p><br><p>Oh, and make sure you listen RIGHT to the end!</p><br><p>A few notes:</p><p>Eumenes, Antigonus, Ptolemy and Seleucus were all prominent players fighting after Alexander the Great\u2019s death.</p><p>Ptolemy was the founder of the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom, centred in Egypt.</p><p>Sarrisas were very long pikes \u2013 roughly 6 metres long.</p><p>The Galatians: a conglomeration of Gallic tribes that settled in modern day central Anatolia.</p><p>We (I mainly) go back and forth between 'Seleucid' and 'Seleukid'.
