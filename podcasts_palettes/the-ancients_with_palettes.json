Famous for its kings like Saul, David and Solomon, the kingdom supposedly emerged in the southern Levant in the late 2nd millennium BC.

Are there any remains that might corroborate what the bible tells us?</p><br><p>In today's episode of The Ancients, Tristan continues our Old Testament mini-series and interviews archeologist Felicity Cobbing.

Famous for its kings like Saul, David and Solomon, the kingdom supposedly emerged in the southern Levant in the late 2nd millennium BC.

Are there any remains that might corroborate what the bible tells us?</p><br><p>In today's episode of The Ancients, Tristan continues our Old Testament mini-series and interviews archeologist Felicity Cobbing. Together they delve into both the biblical narrative and the archaeological evidence in an attempt to answer some the questions that shroud the story of this biblical kingdom.</p><br><p>Presented by Tristan Hughes.

Drawing from research in NASA's Astrobiology archives and Dr. Hallis's own exploration in the Arctic Circle, where she scaled kilometer-high ice mountains with the help of a Red Bull athlete, we explore why the existence of primordial water on Earth is so significant and what implications it holds for the rest of the solar system.</p><br><p><strong>Discover the past on History Hit with ad-free original podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians like Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Matt Lewis, Tristan Hughes and more.

However, amidst the crumbling of Rome, the city of Ravenna emerged as a prominent center, eventually surpassing Milan as the new capital. This begs the question: how did Ravenna attain such significance, and what insights can we glean from the art and architecture that remain there today, particularly from the 5th and 6th centuries?</p><br><p>In this episode, Tristan invites Professor Judith Herrin on to the podcast, to delve into the rise and fall of Ravenna's prominence. Together, they explore its intricate connections with the Western Roman Empire, its interactions with notable entities like the Goths, and the awe-inspiring Christian architecture that adorned its landscape.

However, amidst the crumbling of Rome, the city of Ravenna emerged as a prominent center, eventually surpassing Milan as the new capital. This begs the question: how did Ravenna attain such significance, and what insights can we glean from the art and architecture that remain there today, particularly from the 5th and 6th centuries?</p><br><p>In this episode, Tristan invites Professor Judith Herrin on to the podcast, to delve into the rise and fall of Ravenna's prominence. Together, they explore its intricate connections with the Western Roman Empire, its interactions with notable entities like the Goths, and the awe-inspiring Christian architecture that adorned its landscape.

Examining, and questioning, some long-held assumptions about our distant ancestors, they journey through the mid-pliocene to help piece together this murky moment of history.</p><br><p>The Senior Producer was Elena Guthrie</p><p>The Assistant Producer was Annie Coloe</p><p>Mixed & edited by Aidan Lonergan</p><br><p>For more Ancients content, subscribe to our Ancients newsletter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.historyhit.com/sign-up-to-history-hit/?utm_source=timelinenewsletter&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=Timeline+Podcast+Campaign\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a>&nbsp;</p>",

In this episode, Tristan Hughes is joined by University of Oxford\u2019s Dr Steve Kershaw where together they discuss Hephaestus\u2019s origin story, his controversial marriage to Aphrodite, and why in Dr Kershaw\u2019s words, he is \u201cthe god that should never be underestimated\u201d.&nbsp;</p><br><p>The Senior Producer was Elena Guthrie</p><p>Script written by Andrew Hulse</p><p>Voice over performed by Nichola Woolley</p><p>The Assistant Producer was Annie Coloe</p><br><p>If you enjoyed this episode, you might also enjoy other episodes in the series: <a href=\"https://pod.fo/e/14ec89\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zeus: King of the Gods</a> and <a href=\"https://pod.fo/e/155e77\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hera: Queen of the Gods</a>.</p><br><p>For more Ancients content, subscribe to our Ancients newsletter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.historyhit.com/sign-up-to-history-hit/?utm_source=timelinenewsletter&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=Timeline+Podcast+Campaign\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a>&nbsp;</p><br><p>If you'd like to learn even more, we have hundreds of history documentaries, ad free podcasts and audiobooks at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://access.historyhit.com/?utm_source=audio&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=Podcast+Campaign&utm_id=Podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">History Hit</a>&nbsp;- enter promo code ANCIENTS for a free trial, plus 50% off your first three months' subscription.</p><br><p>To download, go to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.historyhit&hl=en_GB&gl=US\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Android ></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/history-hit/id1303668247\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple store ></a></p>",

And how did these new people perceive ancient monuments such as Stonehenge?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To talk through the study and its results, with a particular focus on certain bronze age burials around Stonehenge, Dr Selina Brace returned to the show. An ancient DNA specialist, Selina works at the Natural History Museum and previously appeared on the Ancients podcast for the hit episode \u2018Cheddar Man: Science and the Skeleton\u2019.</p>",

They were called the Saka, renowned for their skill as horse archers and for their elaborate elite burials.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ancient Persian and Greek sources labelled them a barbaric, nomadic people \u2013 a scourge on the \u2018civilised\u2019 world. But new archaeological discoveries from East Kazakhstan are revealing a very different picture. A picture that highlights how the Saka were a highly-sophisticated ancient society. A culture that boasted complex settlements, expert craftsmen, extensive trade routes and more, alongside their equine mastery and their staggering wealth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, for a limited time only, you can see some of these newly-discovered artefacts at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. The exhibition is called \u2018Gold of the Great Steppe\u2019. Running from 28th&nbsp;September 2021 to 30th&nbsp;January 2022, it is the first exhibition about this ancient culture ever to be shown in the UK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To find out more about the exhibition and what these newly-discovered artefacts are revealing about the Saka, Tristan headed up to Cambridge to interview Dr Rebecca Roberts, associated curator of \u2018Gold of the Great Steppe\u2019.</p><br><p>Gold of the Great Steppe Exhibition: https://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/visit-us/exhibitions/gold-of-the-great-steppe</p>",

Derided by Roman historians as being little more than a bandit, the truth is very much the opposite. For several years, between 17 and 24 AD, Tacfarinas led a revolt against the Romans in North Africa, sending the province into turmoil and becoming the bane of all troops stationed there to fight him. Several times the Romans believed they defeated Tacfarinas and his Berber followers. Several times they were proved wrong as time after time Tacfarinas emerged from the desert with a new force to wreak havoc on wealthy North Africa. For too long, Tacfarinas\u2019 name has been side-lined in favour of more famous 1st century AD Roman rebels such as Boudica, Arminius and Caratacus. Now we\u2019re going to right that wrong. Joining Tristan on today\u2019s podcast is Dr Jo Ball, an Ancients veteran having been on the show twice before. Together Tristan and Jo talk through the incredible story of Tacfarinas and why he really was \u2018the Desert Hydra.\u2019",

Derided by Roman historians as being little more than a bandit, the truth is very much the opposite. For several years, between 17 and 24 AD, Tacfarinas led a revolt against the Romans in North Africa, sending the province into turmoil and becoming the bane of all troops stationed there to fight him. Several times the Romans believed they defeated Tacfarinas and his Berber followers. Several times they were proved wrong as time after time Tacfarinas emerged from the desert with a new force to wreak havoc on wealthy North Africa. For too long, Tacfarinas\u2019 name has been side-lined in favour of more famous 1st century AD Roman rebels such as Boudica, Arminius and Caratacus. Now we\u2019re going to right that wrong. Joining Tristan on today\u2019s podcast is Dr Jo Ball, an Ancients veteran having been on the show twice before. Together Tristan and Jo talk through the incredible story of Tacfarinas and why he really was \u2018the Desert Hydra.\u2019",

It was likely here that the mythical sea monsters of Scylla and Charybdis were supposed to have wreaked havoc on Odysseus\u2019 crew. It was an area of the ancient Mediterranean renowned for its whirlpools and vicious currents. And it was also on either side of this strait, that two ancient cities enjoyed a long and connected history: Rhegium and Messana. To shine a light on this waterway\u2019s importance in antiquity, Tristan was delighted to be joined by Dustin Mackenzie from Macquarie University.",

It was likely here that the mythical sea monsters of Scylla and Charybdis were supposed to have wreaked havoc on Odysseus\u2019 crew. It was an area of the ancient Mediterranean renowned for its whirlpools and vicious currents. And it was also on either side of this strait, that two ancient cities enjoyed a long and connected history: Rhegium and Messana. To shine a light on this waterway\u2019s importance in antiquity, Tristan was delighted to be joined by Dustin Mackenzie from Macquarie University.",

Key mercantile centres, where goods made in Iberia could theoretically have been sold alongside items crafted thousands of miles to the east, in South East Asia. Of these seaports, one of the most remarkable has to be Berenike, a thriving cosmopolitan trading centre, first for the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom and later for Imperial Rome.</p><br><p>To talk through the site\u2019s extraordinary archaeology we were delighted to be joined by Professor Steven Sidebotham from the University of Deleware.

Who was involved in the plot and why did they want to kill him? Did Caesar really say 'et tu Brute?' And what of the more important 'other' Brutus? Emma tells the story of this momentous day.</p><br><p>Quick note: Caesar wasn't technically killed in the Senate House.

In this episode, Dr Emma Southon talks Tristan through the events leading up to the Caesar\u2019s assassination: was he forewarned with omens in the days preceding his death? Who was involved in the plot and why did they want to kill him? Did Caesar really say 'et tu Brute?' And what of the more important 'other' Brutus? Emma tells the story of this momentous day.</p><br><p>Quick note: Caesar wasn't technically killed in the Senate House. He was killed in the senate meeting room, which at that time was held in the Curia of Pompey.</p><p>We also follow the theory that it was upon seeing Decimus Brutus, not Marcus Brutus, that Caesar gave up and stopped resisting his assassins. The debate continues!</p>",

But more recent archaeological work in modern day Jordan is dispelling this myth about the ancient Nabataeans. In this first episode in another two part podcast, Tristan was joined by Professor David Graf from the University of Miami to talk about the early history of the Nabataeans and their close links to the extraordinary ancient city of Petra. A leading expert on the history and archaeology of Petra and its people, David was excavating at the Rose City when Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was being filmed at the ancient site 30 years ago. </p><br><p>David, who has a particular fascination with the early history of the Nabataeans, explained how he has attempted to piece together information about the Nabataeans from various archaeological sources. From papyri fragments to inscriptions to ostraca to rare coinage. Part 2, focused around Petra's later ancient history, will be released soon!</p>",

To shine a light on Hatshepsut, Tristan was delighted to be joined by Lucia Gahlin, a brilliant Egyptologist with a great passion for the story of Hatshepsut. This was a great chat, enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Lucia also stars in our new History Hit documentary about Hatshepsut, featuring alongside the likes of Kara Cooney and Monica Hanna.

Well, in 1920, exactly 100 years ago, another 'frozen city' was rediscovered. This time it was Dura-Europos, and rather than falling victim to a volcano, this city was destroyed after a bloody siege in 256 AD. Whilst there is no historical record of life in the Hellenistic, Parthian and Roman border city and garrison, its remains have proven to be a rich source for archaeologists since the 1920s. Between the only complete example of the semi-cylindrical Roman legionary shield and the perfect oval shields with beautiful paintings of Greeks and Trojans or Greeks and Amazons; beyond the regimental records and complete horse armour and the Palmyrene Gate; archaeologists have uncovered the story of the city. </p><br><p>Tristan was joined on the podcast by Simon James from the University of Leicester, who talked through what we now know about life in Dura-Europa and the relationships between the Roman garrison, their dependents and the other inhabitants. He also offers a play-by-play of the battle which brought this city to a halt, and possibly one of the earliest examples of chemical warfare, all discovered through archaeology.</p>",

Well, in 1920, exactly 100 years ago, another 'frozen city' was rediscovered. This time it was Dura-Europos, and rather than falling victim to a volcano, this city was destroyed after a bloody siege in 256 AD. Whilst there is no historical record of life in the Hellenistic, Parthian and Roman border city and garrison, its remains have proven to be a rich source for archaeologists since the 1920s. Between the only complete example of the semi-cylindrical Roman legionary shield and the perfect oval shields with beautiful paintings of Greeks and Trojans or Greeks and Amazons; beyond the regimental records and complete horse armour and the Palmyrene Gate; archaeologists have uncovered the story of the city. </p><br><p>Tristan was joined on the podcast by Simon James from the University of Leicester, who talked through what we now know about life in Dura-Europa and the relationships between the Roman garrison, their dependents and the other inhabitants. He also offers a play-by-play of the battle which brought this city to a halt, and possibly one of the earliest examples of chemical warfare, all discovered through archaeology.</p>",

In this episode she takes Tristan through this story of the betrayal and destruction of three of Emperor Augustus\u2019 Roman legions - under the leadership of Varus - by a Germanic alliance led by Arminius, a Germanic auxiliary officer brought up as a hostage of the Roman Empire. Together they explore the circumstances which led the Roman leaders to trust a Germanic subject against his fellow Germanic nationals. They also go through the evidence which places the ambush at Kalkriese and the battle\u2019s extensive legacy, some of which stems from conflicting accounts of its location.</p><br><p>Presented by Tristan Hughes (@ancientstristan)</p><p>Featuring Jo Ball (@DrJEBall)</p><p>Edited by Sophie Gee (@SophieGee12)</p>",

For a start, where was it? Dr Joanne Ball, from the University of Liverpool is a battlefield archaeologist. In this episode she takes Tristan through this story of the betrayal and destruction of three of Emperor Augustus\u2019 Roman legions - under the leadership of Varus - by a Germanic alliance led by Arminius, a Germanic auxiliary officer brought up as a hostage of the Roman Empire. Together they explore the circumstances which led the Roman leaders to trust a Germanic subject against his fellow Germanic nationals. They also go through the evidence which places the ambush at Kalkriese and the battle\u2019s extensive legacy, some of which stems from conflicting accounts of its location.</p><br><p>Presented by Tristan Hughes (@ancientstristan)</p><p>Featuring Jo Ball (@DrJEBall)</p><p>Edited by Sophie Gee (@SophieGee12)</p>",

Born into one of the most exciting periods in Roman history, in the early 1st century BC as the Roman Republic started to sing its swansong, Catullus was an aristocrat who moved in powerful circles. He was known to Cicero; he dined with&nbsp;Julius Caesar even after he\u2019d mocked the great leader in verse. Catullus was well-connected, but it was his abiding love for a woman he called Lesbia (probably Clodia Metelli, a powerful woman herself) that inspired much of his poetry, which survived in a single manuscript of 116 verses.</p><br><p>Catullus was revolutionary, bringing a new type of poetry to the fore in ancient Rome. Often his poems were deeply personal, filled to the brim with emotion. Rarely did the young man hold back when pouring his heart out into his verses. Friends and enemies were targeted in sexy and scurrilous poems that continue to shock readers to this day. Nevertheless Catullus' legacy was far-reaching. From Ovid to Byron, Catullus has inspired many of those famous romantic poets that followed him.</p><br><p>To talk through the life of Ancient Rome's 'bad boy poet' (to quote our current Prime Minister Boris Johnson), it was an honour to interview Daisy Dunn, a leading classicist and Catullus' 21st century biographer. In this podcast Daisy brilliantly talks through the life of Catullus and his remarkable legacy. This was a brilliant chat and I hope you enjoy as much as Daisy and I did recording it.</p><br><p>Daisy is the author of Catullus: Rome's Most Erotic Poet.</p>",

                    "itunes:summary": "<p>If you're looking for a raunchy Roman poet, look no further than Catullus. Born into one of the most exciting periods in Roman history, in the early 1st century BC as the Roman Republic started to sing its swansong, Catullus was an aristocrat who moved in powerful circles. He was known to Cicero; he dined with&nbsp;Julius Caesar even after he\u2019d mocked the great leader in verse. Catullus was well-connected, but it was his abiding love for a woman he called Lesbia (probably Clodia Metelli, a powerful woman herself) that inspired much of his poetry, which survived in a single manuscript of 116 verses.</p><br><p>Catullus was revolutionary, bringing a new type of poetry to the fore in ancient Rome. Often his poems were deeply personal, filled to the brim with emotion. Rarely did the young man hold back when pouring his heart out into his verses. Friends and enemies were targeted in sexy and scurrilous poems that continue to shock readers to this day. Nevertheless Catullus' legacy was far-reaching. From Ovid to Byron, Catullus has inspired many of those famous romantic poets that followed him.</p><br><p>To talk through the life of Ancient Rome's 'bad boy poet' (to quote our current Prime Minister Boris Johnson), it was an honour to interview Daisy Dunn, a leading classicist and Catullus' 21st century biographer. In this podcast Daisy brilliantly talks through the life of Catullus and his remarkable legacy. This was a brilliant chat and I hope you enjoy as much as Daisy and I did recording it.</p><br><p>Daisy is the author of Catullus: Rome's Most Erotic Poet.</p>",

But for many, \u2018The Big Three\u2019 means the three great tragedians of Ancient Greece we know so well today: Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. Today\u2019s podcast is all about Sophocles, the creator of famous plays such as Oedipus Rex, Ajax and Antigone.</p><br><p>Seven of his plays survive in full, but believe it or not this is but a morsel of the many works that Sophocles created. Fragments of more than 100 other plays written by Sophocles have been uncovered. Though only snippets survive, and in various forms, they have provided valuable insights into Sophocles\u2019 career and how he wrote much more than just tragedy. Even more extraordinary, to this day new fragments continue to be studied. They continue to reveal more about Sophocles and his works, slowly adding more pieces to the puzzle that is this famous dramatist - and ancient Greek drama as a whole. Sophocles may have been living over 2,500 years ago, but his story is far from over.</p><br><p>I was delighted to be joined by Dr Lyndsay Coo, a leading expert on Sophocles and his lost plays, to talk through the life and legacy of this famous dramatist. We first talk about Sophocles and his seven surviving plays, before going on to the many, many fragments that survive and their significance. This was an enthralling and eye-opening chat. Enjoy.</p>",

But for many, \u2018The Big Three\u2019 means the three great tragedians of Ancient Greece we know so well today: Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. Today\u2019s podcast is all about Sophocles, the creator of famous plays such as Oedipus Rex, Ajax and Antigone.</p><br><p>Seven of his plays survive in full, but believe it or not this is but a morsel of the many works that Sophocles created. Fragments of more than 100 other plays written by Sophocles have been uncovered. Though only snippets survive, and in various forms, they have provided valuable insights into Sophocles\u2019 career and how he wrote much more than just tragedy. Even more extraordinary, to this day new fragments continue to be studied. They continue to reveal more about Sophocles and his works, slowly adding more pieces to the puzzle that is this famous dramatist - and ancient Greek drama as a whole. Sophocles may have been living over 2,500 years ago, but his story is far from over.</p><br><p>I was delighted to be joined by Dr Lyndsay Coo, a leading expert on Sophocles and his lost plays, to talk through the life and legacy of this famous dramatist. We first talk about Sophocles and his seven surviving plays, before going on to the many, many fragments that survive and their significance. This was an enthralling and eye-opening chat. Enjoy.</p>",

The centuries of the 1st millenium BC when Egypt\u2019s power had declined from the heights of rulers such as Ramesses II and Seti I. This late period of ancient Egypt however, is not without drama. It is characterised by repeated invasions and leadership by foreign rulers - Kushites, Libyans, Assyrians, Persians and then ultimately the Macedonians with Alexander the Great and his Ptolemaic successors.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Presented by Tristan Hughes.

Among its many works of art is a depiction of Alexander the Great in battle. In previous episodes we have discussed Alexander\u2019s rule and empire, but in this interview with Gregory Aldrete Tristan focuses on Alexander's armour, for, instead of wearing bronze or iron armour as one might expect, Alexander is going into battle wearing a breastplate of linen.</p><br><p>Gregory Aldrete has spent 12 years studying the composition and effectiveness of this ancient armour used by many nations around the Mediterranean. To do so, he recreated the armour from scratch, using authentic materials. In this fascinating interview Gregory, Professor Emeritus from The University of Wisconsin, Green Bay, speaks with Tristan about how this armour protected one of the most powerful conquering armies of all history, despite being made of a soft fabric.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode was produced by Joseph Knight and edited by Aidan Lonergan</p><br><p><strong>Enjoy unlimited access to award-winning original documentaries that are released weekly and AD-FREE podcasts.
