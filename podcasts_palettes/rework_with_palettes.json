It felt like a product launch!\u00a0</p><p>[05:04] - Eron reflects on the accelerated timeline and how the entire ops and SIP team worked towards the same goal.</p><p>[06:32] - How the criticality ladder approach allowed for smoother progress to more complex applications like Basecamp Classic.</p><p>[08:47] - Eron explains the logistics and the unexpected trick that helped the team tackle individual components without risking significant disruptions.</p><p>[10:52] - Moving <a href='https://www.hey.com/world/'>HEY,</a> 37signals most critical and complex app, that had never before been run outside the cloud.\u00a0</p><p>[11:23] - Kimberly opens the floor to a few user questions from Twitter, the first one from Pedro: &quot;Did your company buy or already own your own data centers, or are you renting space in existing data centers?

Before deciding to move, did you try negotiating with any of the large clouds?&quot;</p><p>[16:54] - David shares their unique advantage in cloud pricing negotiations.</p><p>[19:46] - Why the cloud math doesn&apos;t work: the fundamental misalignment (and huge surprise costs) that led 37signals to leave the cloud and how running your own infrastructure makes those financial surprises disappear.\u00a0</p><p>[21:11] - Kimberly shares a telling comment made by someone on David\u2019s <a href='https://twitter.com/dhh'>Twitter</a> account.\u00a0</p><p>[22:26] - How the cloud marketing campaign has successfully convinced people they&apos;re dumber than they really are.\u00a0</p><p>[24:49] - &quot;If you possess the know-how and resources, it absolutely makes sense to manage your own infrastructure.&quot; Eron shares the advantage that made the transition less daunting.\u00a0</p><p>[25:32] - Ki</p>",
