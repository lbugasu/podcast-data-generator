Marques, Andrew, and David give their thoughts on the new iPhone 16, AirPods 4th gen, and the new Apple Watch Series 10. Then we play a small game where we quickly discuss a handful of news topics that range from the new YouTube Hype feature to Flappy Bird, and we try to decide whether they matter or not.
