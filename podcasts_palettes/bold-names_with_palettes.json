That includes cloud storage company Box, which has seen its stock climb nearly 40% this year.

So why does he think that could actually lead to more jobs for humans?

Peter Rawlinson is the CEO of Lucid, a billion-dollar auto startup he says has better technology than its rivals. The company recently completed a $1.75 billion stock offering, and has backing from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund.

Plus, why he says he won\u2019t be building a $20,000 EV any time soon. He speaks to WSJ\u2019s Tim Higgins and Christopher Mims in episode one of our interview series Bold Names.\n\n\n\nLet us know what you think of the show.

WSJ mining and commodities reporter Rhiannon Hoyle speaks with host Danny Lewis about why countries and companies are finding alternatives to rare earths. Plus, Oak Ridge National Laboratory engineer Burak Ozpineci tells us where new motors could take the EV industry.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think about the show?
