            "description": "Poet Major Jackson is your guide on the pathways to feel and understand our common journey \u2013 through poetry. In sharing poems, we take a moment to pause and acknowledge the world\u2019s magnitude, and how poets illuminate that mystery. Join The Slowdown for a poem and a moment of reflection in one short episode, every weekday. Produced by APM Studios in partnership with The Poetry Foundation and supported in part by the National Endowment for the Arts.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Slowdown is your daily poetry ritual. Make us a part of your routine as you drink coffee in the morning, as you take a walk in nature, or as you wind down to go to sleep in the evening. With host Major Jackson, we collectively take a moment to calm, to inspire, to learn, and to engage with the best emerging poets and established writers of our time and generations past, from Emily Dickinson to Danez Smith, from Amanda Gorman to Mary Oliver.\n<br/>\n<br/>Listen to our back catalog for episodes by our previous hosts, Tracy K. Smith and Ada Lim\u00f3n,  as well as guest hosts Jenny Xie, Brenda Shaughnessy, Tina Chang, Nate Marshall, Shira Erlichiman, and Jason Schneiderman. Our hosts and production team select poems that move them, and we hope they move you, too.",

In honor of this important milestone editors Danielle Legros Georges and Artress Bethany White solicited Black female poets to write in the manner of Phillis Wheatley, or creatively reinscribe what is found in the text as some of her abiding images and important themes. The anthology, Wheatley at 250, from which today\u2019s poem is taken, honors and celebrates the immense legacy of Phillis Wheatley Peters, whose work matters to all of us who cherish the possibilities of poems and poets to represent the highest ideals of literacy, and the miracle of language to free us.\u201d </p><br/><p>Celebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.

In this episode, Major writes\u2026 \u201cBecause of my family\u2019s addiction issues, I spoke out of fear to my children, and often rather harshly. I worried particularly that they would fall prey to the opioid epidemic that hit the state of Vermont, a fentanyl crisis as severe as the rest of the country. Several friends grieved the loss of children to overdose. I wish I had told my children of my casual experiment with drugs, moments that scared me so much I knew if I went further I would not survive. But it turns out I did not need to reference my journey. The music they listened to, and the rappers they admired spoke about a life they could only picture in their heads, which was ironic and a blessing. The music did not merely glorify drugs but mourned the demise of artists, storytellers, friends, and collaborators.\u201d <br><br>Celebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.

Through her writing, which includes short- and long-form fiction, nonfiction, spells, tarot decks and poetry; her music, which includes songwriting, singing and immersive musical rituals; and her podcasts, including How to Survive the End of the World, Octavia\u2019s Parables and The Emergent Strategy Podcast, adrienne has nurtured Emergent Strategy, Pleasure Activism, Radical Imagination and Transformative Justice as ideas, frameworks, networks and practices for transformation. Her work is informed by 25 years of social and environmental justice facilitation primarily supporting Black liberation, her path of teaching somatics, her love of Octavia E. Butler and visionary fiction, and her work as a doula. </p><br/><p>The Slowdown is your daily poetry ritual. In this episode, adrienne shares\u2026 \u201cFor me, poetry is how I get to be my whole human self in a given moment, and really, connect to that river \u2014 I always talk about [how] there&#39;s this river of love and justice that&#39;s flowing from the beginning of time to the end and it flows through us to different degrees. We&#39;re supposed to do that kind of work, but it has to be able to hold the whole complexity of a given moment. It has to be able to hold life and death \u2014 really life and death \u2014 over and over again in a variety of ways.\u201d </p><br/><p>Celebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.

From the time I was a little girl, it didn&#39;t feel historical, in fact, it felt like that is the place I want to be, and I yearned for it all of my life. I understand what that yearning is. What it is, is to be a part of something that is a freedom movement. But it&#39;s not just a movement. a collective freedom movement. It&#39;s an individual movement too, through the creation of art. Those artists were, through expressing themselves, understanding themselves, and learning about themselves, and their contribution to the world allowed us to see ourselves in their art.\u201d </p><br/><p>Celebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.

They also play language as though words were comprised of tones and notes, as though the poem were a musical composition. They treat language as a resource by creating echoes through rhyme or cadence or incantation. Others give language a skin by utilizing words that have a roughness to them. Then other poets map a route to individuality by capturing words, and phrases and heard speech only particular to a region or group of people.

We gently coaxed them into glass mason jars then sat on the stoop counting their lights to see who had the most. Their underbellies lit up and cast a glow onto our faces. Later, beneath a sheet in bed, I stared into the jar as the fireflies crawled the glass and emitted their light.\u201d </p><br/><p>Celebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.

What children observe may drive them as adults to positively replicate their parent\u2019s model, attempt to fulfill their parents&#39; lack , or avoid intimacy altogether.

Memes are by definition a form, much like a poetic form. You can put different text upon the same picture, and the picture invites a certain read, much like using a sonnet or sestina. Maybe the proliferation of memes has\u2026 simplified our expressions of some experiences. But this expansive vocabulary of internet shorthand has also helped me commune and commiserate and connect with the people in my life over the things we feel and see every day. As our listener A. Rafael told us, those poems which really connect are much the same \u2014 they put language to a bit of life that feels large and unwieldy inside of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Celebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.

In this episode, Major writes\u2026 \u201cSome days, we bicker, nothing major (pun intended). Often, it\u2019s minor: control of the thermostat, recycling duty, my general proclivity to forget. On very rare occasions, we hit upon a disagreement that requires work \u2014 where we need to figure out why we react so strongly. I have not been in a romantic relationship that did not require work. I mean come-to-your-maker kind of work. I\u2019m talking emotional work that has you question every decision you have made up till that moment and every decision you will make thereafter. Faint of heart? Don\u2019t even go there. Too awed by your own existence? You might be better off alone. Allergic to change? Incapable of adapting? Only the rotation of the sun is a constant; all else is subject to life\u2019s mutability and human fallibility. The most stable of relationships account for this fact.\u201d</p><br/><p>Celebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.

The journey to insights and those momentary stays against confusion are often filled with inarticulate, wayward wanderings and long stretches of speechlessness. Part of my love of poetry is owed to how it stages eloquence and puts a finishing touch on the thing that I finally needed to say.

The Slowdown is your daily poetry ritual. </p><br/><p>In this episode, Major writes\u2026 &quot;We, here, at the Slowdown are celebrating our 1000th episode. This is a milestone deserving of its own reflection. I\u2019ve three observations before we raise our public media coffee mugs or flutes of sparkling cider for a communal toast. </p><br/><p>1. One thousand poems are in circulation with opening remarks in what effectively is an audio anthology on our website. For teachers, parents, and lovers of the written word, what an invaluable resource! The commentaries by our hosts and guest hosts make an irrefutable argument about the place of poetry in our lives. We invite you to return to your favorite poets and poems. Or choose a significant date, such as your birthday, and treat yourself to the immense talent we\u2019ve featured on that day over the past five years. </p><br/><p>2. Personally, I am swallowed up by so much in my day-to-day life. As a member of a caring community, I also experience the sweep of history and its conflicts which make themselves present everyday. I ponder the struggle to enact laws and policies that uphold our freedom; and I contemplate the reach of global conflicts. In my opinion, nothing dignifies our existence like the poem which, in the midst of that swirl, comes forth as the voice of a human soul, as an individual speaking, testifying, witnessing it all. </p><br/><p>When I encounter the poem on the page, I am afforded the profound and intimate pleasure of hearing someone\u2019s inner thoughts. What we try to do on The Slowdown is to preserve that intimacy. Every poem advances our humanity in language. It captures so much more that is intimate and telling. Our better selves are explored, given the stage, rather than our base needs which often sets us in conflict. We\u2019ve a tenderness to us. Poetry allows that softness to come to the fore where we are more reflective, more conciliatory, more in concert with each other.</p><br/><p>3. Poets urge me to not look away. To see everything which can be difficult. Thank you for slowing down and seeing with us. </p><br/><p>Today\u2019s poem, by an essential American poet, reminds me why this show matters. We want \u2014 no, need \u2014 to hear and honor the whole expanse of human existence.&quot;</p>",

Brown and actress/poet Amber Tamblyn at Coop Gallery. They stood behind a makeshift boat fashioned from a card table turned on its side and invited everyone to imagine they were in it. We were no longer in a gallery but on the seas, being carried along by their stand-up comedic performance and poetry. The evening reminded me of readings of yore, the kind of ease and whimsy that happens between artists and longtime compatriots \u2014 no stiff explications of theory smothering a poem, no solemn acts of confession, just a shared vulnerability and intimacy, an overflowing love between friends.\u201d </p><br/><p>Celebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.

In this episode, Major writes\u2026 \u201cMy life is a constant stream of deadlines, such that I am forever trying to fit in what I love most \u2014 writing poetry. When I worked in the corporate finance office of a popular clothing retail store , I worked a regular 9-5. Back then, my life was more structured, and poetry bookended my days. I arose in the dark of morning and scribbled opening lines that would unfold into a larger piece. Light spread across the sky and only birdsong could be heard. I miss those days.  When did writing poetry become something that I \u201cfit in\u201d? Trust me; I find meaning in all of my activities, work-related or domestic. But only one satiates this ongoing spirit of becoming, which is what creating is about. In that solitude, with each poem I wrote, I saw myself more clearly. \u201d </p><br/><p>Celebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.

Planning travel to other countries feels burdensome with all the flight preparation and itinerary building. I lose my sense of excitement.

I felt a joyous connection to all around me, artists and writers and musicians, thinkers and believers, both living and departed, alive in their pursuit of beauty and knowledge. I was starving and knew it. On South Street, one bookstore stayed open till midnight. Many nights I closed it down, sitting in a corner reading a paperback, a beer in my pocket or a cup of coffee in my hand. At some point, I knew I needed to make art, to move to celebrating the world\u2019s loveliness.

Many psychological experts suggest making affection and tenderness appropriately visible in the lives of children. It goes far to ensure emotional stability. What children observe may drive them as adults to positively replicate their parent\u2019s model, attempt to fulfill their parents&#39; lack, or avoid intimacy altogether.

Her work is partnered with the Message in a Bottle project, which invites anyone to have their name etched on the microchip mounted to the outside of the spacecraft. Our producer, Myka Kielbon, met with Ada in the ceremonial offices of the Poet Laureate in the Library of Congress, to connect on this moment that merges science, art and humanity. </p><br/><p>A shortened version of their conversation is in today\u2019s podcast feed.

And thus, we acknowledge and survive off each other\u2019s radiance, a moral beauty, as the ancient Greeks believed, that equated to goodness. \u201d </p><br/><p>Celebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.

When I worked in the corporate finance office of a popular clothing retail store, I worked a regular 9-5. Back then, my life was more structured, and poetry bookended my days. I arose in the dark of morning and scribbled opening lines that would unfold into a larger piece. Light spread across the sky and only birdsong could be heard. I miss those days.  When did writing poetry become something that I \u201cfit in\u201d? Trust me; I find meaning in all of my activities, work-related or domestic. But only one satiates this ongoing spirit of becoming, which is what creating is about. In that solitude, with each poem I wrote, I saw myself more clearly. \u201d Celebrate the power of poems with a gift to The Slowdown today.
