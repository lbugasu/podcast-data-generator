            "description": "A podcast about pivoting for startups.\n\nCTRL SHIFT is a podcast about people who changed the world by changing their perspective. Every start-up goes through periods of being stuck. We believe the key factor in successfully overcoming them is being able to shift: focus, goals, approach, or even to shift altogether to another area. In each episode we tell the story of a shift that we think is a good example - if not, then at least a good lesson for entrepreneurs. We explore all the surprising twists and turns along the way, how talent in one field can turn out to be just what\u2019s needed in another, how to make a successful U-turn when needed; and how, at the end of the day, adaptability is crucial in both business and life.",

Every start-up goes through periods of being stuck. We believe the key factor in successfully overcoming them is being able to shift: focus, goals, approach, or even to shift altogether to another area. In each episode we tell the story of a shift that we think is a good example - if not, then at least a good lesson for entrepreneurs. We explore all the surprising twists and turns along the way, how talent in one field can turn out to be just what\u2019s needed in another, how to make a successful U-turn when needed; and how, at the end of the day, adaptability is crucial in both business and life.",
