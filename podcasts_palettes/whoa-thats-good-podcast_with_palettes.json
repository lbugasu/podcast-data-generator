It's so easy to be frustrated when we think we've been planting good seeds, putting in good and God-glorifying work, but our hopes and dreams aren't coming to fruition. Sadie wants to encourage us to not fall into the temptation of getting angry or frustrated with God, but evaluate the kinds of work - the kinds of seeds - we're doing and planting. Are they meant to only impress? Or to prosper for generations to come? Plus, Sadie reveals an amazing way God has surprised her 10 years later after thinking she'd closed the door on an opportunity forever!\u00a0\n\nThis Episode of WHOA That's Good is Sponsored by:\nhttps://give.cru.org/good or text GOOD to 71326 \u2014 Get a free copy of Sadie and Christian's new book \"How to Put Love First\" with your monthly gift!\nhttps://www.covenanteyes.com/sadie \u2014 Try Covenant Eyes FREE for 30 days with promo code WHOA.\nhttps://drinkag1.com/whoa \u2014 Get a FREE 1-year supply of Vitamin D3+K2 AND 5 free AG1 Travel Packs with your first subscription!\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.

She's honest about her insecurities and fears when she initially sensed what God was asking her to speak about. She takes us through her struggles when Haven needed a hospital stay hours before leaving for Atlanta and brings us along as she stepped out onto that stage in front of 60,000 people. Later, Korie and Christian join her to talk about their own parts in her preparation and Christian and Sadie still can't get over an overwhelming moment of worship in the stadium that could only be described as \"otherworldly\" and full of the presence of God. Don't miss one minute of her remembering this journey and be encouraged for the start of your year to go confidently where God is leading!\u00a0\n\nWatch Sadie\u2019s message at Passion 2024: https://youtu.be/mexwJQhyack\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Mia can't wait to ditch her smartphone when she studies abroad, but Sadie makes the case why Mia needs to return to Instagram when she's back. Jase shares what's been hardest for him and his wife, Missy, as they have walked through Mia's many surgeries, setbacks, and doctor's appointments since the time she was born with a cleft palate \u2014 and now why it's been so important for their family to help support other families with children with cleft palates. Sadie is stunned to hear how much pain Mia was in after one big surgery. Sadie and Mia talk about the shift when they both started speaking out publicly about their faith and Mia admits she used to be too embarrassed to share spiritual\u00a0things, but now she carries her\u00a0Bible with her wherever she goes \u2014 just like her dad. Jase is moved to tears remembering Mia's piano playing in the upcoming Christmas episode of \"Duck Family Treasure,\" which he says is the most special sharing of the Gospel he's ever seen on cable TV.

Taylor Cain Matz and Madison Cain Johnson are two-thirds of the CAIN trio and\u00a0are just as fun and full of life in-person as they are on-stage and in their music videos. With massive hits like \"Rise Up (Lazarus)\" and \"I'm So Blessed,\" the sisters reflect on how they almost quit music entirely after five years of trying to make it in country music and getting nowhere - even losing money! Sadie wants to know what touring is like with infants and toddlers and how is it working & living so closely together on and off the road. The CAIN sisters challenge us to trust God when He's called you to something \u2014 He'll make a way and equip you! Madison and Taylor remember when they found out they were expecting at the same time which has Sadie recalling how she found out she was pregnant with Honey a few minutes before a big interview! And don't miss a great word of encouragement from all three women about choosing to celebrate your sisters and friends rather than feeling the need to compete!

Discernment vs. intuition, making decisions, going through a dark night of the soul \u2014 they cover SO much in this conversation and you won't want to miss a second! Terra explains why she starts every counseling session by praying and asking the \"Real Counselor\" to lead. Sadie and Terra then get into decision-making and why it's okay to delay making big decisions if you're not in a good place, but there may be times you might need to force yourself to make the choice to get yourself unstuck. And no, you CAN'T always trust your feelings when you're making decisions! Plus, Terra shares her \"little questions\" that will be\u00a0a valuable\u00a0tool for you as you navigate changing seasons and big\u00a0choices! And have you ever felt mad at God for something that's happened? Sadie has and she reveals a moment not too long ago where that was true. Don't miss when Terra then begins an impromptu counseling session to prompt Sadie to go deeper and explore WHY she was mad and what made her resolve it.\u00a0\n--\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Sadie asks Willie about that early part of his childhood, when his dad wasn't a believer yet, and how Phil and Miss Kay's decision to follow the Lord quite literally changed their family's trajectory. Willie and Sadie challenge us to find ourselves in the film's story: Are you the person praying for someone in your life who's not in a good place? Is your marriage in trouble? Are you sharing the Gospel with someone in your life again and again but not seeing them change their mind? Ministry is everywhere and can be anything, big or small! For some it means writing books, speaking all over the world to large audiences, but for others, it can be simple acts of kindness and grace for anyone we encounter throughout the day.

Korie and Rebecca are talking all about how Rebecca joined the Robertson family when she was 16 years old as an exchange student from Taiwan. Rebecca says she felt very welcome in her new family, but very out of her comfort zone and shares how she adjusted to the big changes in the USA: from language to school and church and being at LSU when \"Duck Dynasty\" first began. Rebecca reveals how difficult it was to lose her dad at a young age, but why she now chooses to be positive with whatever she encounters in her life. And how did 2Mama play a role in Rebecca meeting her husband, John Reed? As a wife and mother of two, Rebecca admits some days are easier than others and the thoughts of, \"Is this my life now?\" can be overwhelming, but Korie's encouragement for anyone feeling like they're barely making it is to remember that you CAN do it all \u2014 everything God has placed on your heart \u2014 just not all at once!\u00a0\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Laney describes how you should not place your happiness in the hands of others,\u00a0especially ones who talk about\u00a0you behind your\u00a0back.

April talks about the phone call she received that changed her and her family's life, when her brother was in a horrible car accident that took his life.

Nate admits his early years as a Christian were a \"check-the-box\" version: read your Bible - check, go to church - check, pray - check\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 but an experience in college changed all that and his outlook transformed to a \"get-to\" attitude in his walk with God. Sadie and Nate share different ways they experienced the call of God on their lives and reiterate that when God's calling you, it doesn't have to make sense to anyone else! Nate remembers the early days in Atlanta where Housefires began and the moment he says was \"the most special moment in worship he's ever seen\" when \"Good Good Father\" was first spoken \u2014 and he has Sadie saying, \"That's SO good\" many times when he explains the origin of his first tattoo and how a two-degree shift can change EVERYTHING for you in your life!\u00a0\n\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.

They discuss the best conversation you could ever possibly have, how to live for eternity when everyone is so focused on the here and now, and how to make sure we're not living a self-centered Christianity. David also shares the frightening experience of being successful in the American church when he wasn't truly walking with God. We will always find ourselves stagnating until we commit to serve the world and share, show, and teach the Word. Be the light to someone this week, friends!
