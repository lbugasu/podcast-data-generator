As Katherine says, no one can tell YOU how to feel about your own story \u2014 that's something you get to decide and she almost had to die to truly find this life-altering hope. Sadie and Katherine talk about the importance of showing up for friends and family in especially hard circumstances and why not knowing what to say is okay! After this conversation, we know you're going to feel lighter and more hopeful about what's currently going on in your life. We can do this hard life because we are NOT alone \u2014 we have Jesus and we have each other!

Jess talks about\u00a0finding herself at her publisher's office pitching a book about being tired when she was as close to complete burnout and a breakdown as she'd ever been. But through doing a deep dive on what \"tired\" really means \u2014 and what God meant when He said, \"Come to Me all who are weary\" \u2014 she discovered a wealth of knowledge about how we navigate exhaustion and WHY we're all so tired (it's not always because we need sleep!).

But in this episode they're discussing ALL sides of our culture's eagerness to unfollow, deride and condemn.

Sadie and Korie discuss the danger of criticism, how Christians can be in the world but not OF the world, how Jesus was \"canceled\" by both sides and what IS too far when it comes to posting? And is it even possible for believers to \"please\" both the world and fellow Christians?

One picture\u00a0+ one caption does not ever tell the whole story of that person.\u00a0\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

Willie and Sadie challenge us to find ourselves in the film's story: Are you the person praying for someone in your life who's not in a good place? Is your marriage in trouble? Are you sharing the Gospel with someone in your life again and again but not seeing them change their mind? Ministry is everywhere and can be anything, big or small! For some it means writing books, speaking all over the world to large audiences, but for others, it can be simple acts of kindness and grace for anyone we encounter throughout the day. And remember NO ONE is outside of God's love \u2014 never give up on anyone and let the Holy Spirit work on their hearts!\u00a0Watch \"The Blind\" in theaters starting September 28.

Sadie and Korie are sharing stories of when they were the most fearful, anxious and worried and how they've learned to stop those dangerous loops and how to keep moving forward, doing it afraid! Korie remembers a time when little Sadie was overcome with anxiety at camp, but how that\u00a0one moment was a pivot for how Sadie confronted anxiety later in her life ... and why you sometimes need to feel the fear to push you! Plus what are some practical ways we can stop anxiety and worry in its tracks? Sadie and Korie share their strategies that\u00a0include everything from washing your hands in warm water to making a gratitude list. But ultimately, knowing and trusting God and relying on His promises is the best way to prepare for trials and getting through difficult moments that can come seemingly out of nowhere.

Rebekah joins Korie to share her five rules for not just overcoming anxiety but why steering INTO anxiety helps us build up resilience in our lives. Don't RUN from anything that makes you afraid, rather learn how to not let it control and override\u00a0your entire life. Korie shares how she worked with Sadie on knowing when she was having an anxiety attack and how to work through it. Rebekah talks about why she started focusing on becoming resilient in her life and pursuing a journey of emotional health with the Lord. Plus, why do we feel the instinct to pull away when relationships get too intimate or too personal? And how can we encourage each other to be ourselves and be human, even though we want to show only the best versions of ourselves? Rebekah shares one moment and one phrase uttered to her husband that changed her life \u2014 and she encourages us ALL to not be afraid to name our pain! We can't begin healing if we haven't named the pain in our hearts and minds! And how can we retrain our brain and\u00a0be more aware of what \u2014 and Who \u2014 we're agreeing with in our darker moments? Rebekah's book \"Building a Resilient Life\" is available now!\u00a0\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

April is a former financial planner and now hosts a podcast and has written a devotional book. April talks about the phone call she received that changed her and her family's life, when her brother was in a horrible car accident that took his life. But through hearing from others about how much her brother had meant to them, especially those who heard about Jesus from him, she was convicted to more quickly share Christ with those she encountered every day. April encourages us all that when we're tempted to ask if God is REALLY good, or if God is really for us in the dark times, we need to recall and rely on what we know to be true about who God is, and that should get us into God's Word! Sadie and April talk about the call of ministry and how it doesn't matter how \"big\" or \"small\" the platform might be, ministry is always important! And for anyone going through a terribly painful time right now, know this: If there's a shadow, there's light! You can trust in your Savior who is with you every step of the way until you're on the other side!\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

Y'all, he brings a WORD in this episode! KB reveals how he came to follow the Lord after someone loaned him a Christian hip-hop CD and why his new book is his prayer for recovery and revival in our world today. Just listen to how he speaks about the Lord and you'll feel a revived spirit! KB encourages us to have godly people around us REGULARLY and shares the best antidote for a heaviness of spirit. Plus, he recalls when his faith was truly put to the test on a dangerous mission\u00a0trip and his \"aha\" moment that there is more joy in following Jesus into the scary place than there is staying cooped up in rebellion and disobedience. Sadie describes her trip to Somalia where her fear and anxiety hit its peak and how her faith being put to the test was the ultimate show of trust in God's mercy and grace. Since then, fear and anxiety haven't ruled her heart like they once did. If God is calling you to dangerous situations and dangerous faith, remember you serve a dangerous God! KB's book, \"Dangerous Jesus,\" is available now.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

David encourages anyone in a relationship \u2014 romantic or otherwise \u2014 how to keep learning how to love the other person well. Sadie shares how her love languages have switched since she started dating Christian and encourages us to keep asking our person how we can love them best in this moment. Plus, it IS possible to have a potentially divisive conversation with other believers as long as the spirit of the discussion is humility, openness, and hearing each other. You can still agree to disagree, and actually mean it! As David reiterates, if it's not what UNITES us (Jesus, the authority of the Bible, the Gospel), then it shouldn't be what DIVIDES us. And what would happen if all believers were truly meditating on God's Word? Forget the excuses about why you can't memorize Scripture and start today! David's newest book is \"Don't Hold Back: Leaving Behind the American Gospel to Follow Jesus Fully.\"\n\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

Korie is back to share a TON of advice on all the things \u2014 whether it's starting college and you don't vibe with your roommate yet (or at all), being broke with no plan as a married couple, finding yourself suddenly\u00a0single, and the blessings of hospitality, not just for those who attend, but for the host too! Sadie shares a story about her childhood and encourages us to not be too quick to complain about not feeling settled or having community if you're not taking the time to plant roots \u2014 you'll never get the tree unless you stay and nourish the ground! Plus, how are you stewarding your friendships, even as seasons change? Sadie reiterates that not every friend in your life will be your best friend, but that doesn't mean they can't be good friends! And don't miss Korie's tale of a train trip through Europe and Willie chasing down a thief on the train, jumping from car to car.\u00a0\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
