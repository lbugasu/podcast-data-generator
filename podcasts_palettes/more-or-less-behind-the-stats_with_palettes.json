But it turns out there are no official figures for the number of transgender people in the UK. We explore what we do know, and what is harder to measure.</p><p>Do 4% of the population drink nearly a third of the alcohol?</p><p>According to recent headlines, just 4% of the population drink nearly a third of the alcohol sold in England. But can so few people really account for so much of the countries bar tab? We find out where the statistic came from. </p><p>Bank of England\u2019s Mark Carney says no to RPI</p><p>At a hearing of the House of Lords\u2019 economic affairs committee, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said it would be useful to have a single measure of inflation for consumers \u2013 and that CPI was a much better measure than RPI, which he said had \u201cno merit\u201d. We find out why with the FT\u2019s Chris Giles.</p><p>A statistical take on parkrun</p><p>Every weekend over 1.5 million people run 5,000m on Saturday mornings for parkrun which is a free event that takes place all over the UK and indeed across the globe. Each runner is given a bar code, which is scanned at the end of the run and fed into a database showing them what place they came in their race\u2013 we take a look at which courses are the fastest, slowest, hardest and easiest. </p><p>Testing for a cough correlation between snooker and smoking</p><p>A listener emailed us this week to ask whether you can connect the number of coughs during snooker matches to the decline in smoking. We got counting to see if the theory was a trick shot - with help from John Virgo. </p><p>Photo: Jimmy White\nCredit: Photo by Jamie McDonald/Getty Images</p>"

He says nurses are actually paid \u00a331,000 - more than the average person.

Did the SNP lose seven seats or gain six.

This all hinges on how you look at the results last time around and how you account for the major boundary review that took place between elections.

A listener asks More or Less to explore this powerful statement - \"More girls were killed in the last 50 years, precisely because they were girls, than men killed in all the wars in the 20th century.\" The quote is from a book called 'Half the Sky' by Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. It has been used in articles, by UN agencies and on TV to highlight the fatal consequences of discrimination of women based on their sex. But is it true? More or Less looks at the evidence. How can we know if a woman is killed precisely because she is a woman? And how do we know how many men have been killed in war?</p>"

Also, are the four festive football fixtures as crucial to Premier League teams as many claim? And, in tribute to the former BBC economics editor, Stephanie Flanders, listen to what was perhaps her finest broadcasting moment.</p>"
