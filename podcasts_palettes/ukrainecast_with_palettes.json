She's in Lviv, which was targeted for the first time today and is also where Vitaly\u2019s mum and aunt have just arrived.\n\nAnd the BBC\u2019s World Affairs Editor, John Simpson, gives us a special insight into the one of the latest rounds of diplomatic calls \u2013 this time between President Putin and Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2013 and what it suggests about Putin\u2019s state of mind.\n\nThis episode of Ukrainecast was made by Daniel Wittenberg with Natalie Ktena, Alix Pickles, and Phil Marzouk.
