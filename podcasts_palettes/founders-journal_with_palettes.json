Gumroad does nearly $20m per year, is highly profitable, and has no full-time employees. In the essay, Sahil talks about leaving Pinterest as its second employee in 2011, to build his life\u2019s work\u2026a company called Gumroad that would be worth billions of dollars, IPO one day an employ hundreds of people. But that\u2019s not what happened. In 2015, Sahil laid off 75% of Gumroad\u2019s staff to keep the company alive. Of course firing some of his best friends was heart-wrenching. But possibly just as difficult for Sahil was the death of his dream to build a venture-backed unicorn.

In addition to listening to this pod I highly recommend you follow Jason on twitter, check out his blog posts (which I\u2019ll link to in the show notes), and read his books Getting Real, REWORK, and Remote. On this episode of Founder\u2019s Journal I pick some of my favorite Fried musings from over the years to discuss with him. These range from how to build good culture to what good leadership looks like, having the right mindset for business adversity & much much more.\n\nJason Fried blog: https://world.hey.com/jason\nJason Fried Twitter: https://x.com/jasonfried?s=20\n\nSend us an email and let us know what you think of the idea! foundersjournal@morningbrew.com\n\n#FoundersJournal #Startups #Entrepreneur\nListen to Founder\u2019s Journal\u00a0here: https://link.chtbl.com/OV4W93_W\nWatch Founder\u2019s Journal here: https://www.youtube.com/@FoundersJournal/\u00a0\n\nSubscribe to Morning Brew!\nSign up for free today:\u00a0https://bit.ly/morningbrewyt\nFollow The Brew!\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/morningbrew/\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/MorningBrew\nTik Tok - https://www.tiktok.com/@morningbrew\n\nFollow Alex!\nAlex Lieberman (@businessbarista)\nLearn more about your ad choices.
