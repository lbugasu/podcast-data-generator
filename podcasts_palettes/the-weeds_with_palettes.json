Montana, and the plaintiffs want to prove the state\u2019s energy policies directly harm the Montana environment. In today\u2019s episode of The Weeds, we\u2019ll dig into the case with Amanda Eggert (@amandaleggert), environmental reporter at the Montana Free Press, and also hear from a plaintiff about why she decided to join the lawsuit.\u00a0\n\nYou can read more reporting from Amanda on the Montana legislature, state energy policy, and the environment at MontanaFreePress.org\n\nWe reached out to the Montana attorney general\u2019s office for comment. Here is the full statement below:\u00a0\n\n\u201cFollowing the legislative session, there are no existing laws or policies for the district court to rule on. A show trial on laws that do not exist, as the district court seems intent on holding, would be a colossal waste of taxpayer resources. This same lawsuit has been thrown out of federal court and courts in a dozen other states \u2014 and it should be dismissed here in Montana as well.\u201d \u2014Emily Flower, spokeswoman for Attorney General Austin Knudsen\n\n\u201cThis entire lawsuit is a meritless publicity stunt to increase fundraising for their political activism at the expense of Montana taxpayers. Our Children\u2019s Trust is a special-interest group that is exploiting well-intentioned Montana kids \u2014 including a 4-year-old and an 8-year-old \u2014 to achieve its goal of shutting down responsible energy development in our state. Unable to implement their policies through the normal processes of representative government, these out-of-state climate activists are trying to use liberal courts to impose their authoritarian climate agenda on Montanans.\u201d \u2014Kyler Nerison, communications director for Attorney General Austin Knudsen\n\nCredits:\nJonquilyn Hill, host\nSofi LaLonde, producer\nCristian Ayala, engineer\nA.M.

They talk about how the allure of measurement and precision spread from astronomy to the social sciences, why advertising became so bound to the operation of the internet, and how we can imagine a more democratic future for us and our data, given the unprecedented power of today's tech companies.\nHost: Sean Illing (@seanilling), host, The Gray Area\nGuest: Matthew L.
