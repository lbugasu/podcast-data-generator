How do you convince people to buy a house on the Internet? How do you sell thousands of dog ramps to weiner dogs all across America when a pandemic breaks the global supply chain?\u00a0\r\n\r\nHosted by former Planet Money host Jacob Goldstein, What\u2019s Your Problem helps listeners understand the problems really smart people are trying to solve right now.\r\n\r\niHeartMedia is the exclusive podcast partner of Pushkin Industries.",

Journalist and author David Pogue finds the untold creation stories behind the most mind-blowing advances in\u00a0science\u00a0and tech\u2014and hears from the characters involved\u2014from their first inspiration to the times they almost gave up. This episode looks at the bad guys who used software bots to sign up for millions of fake email accounts\u2014for sending out spam. Then, PhD student Luis Von Ahn stopped them. He invented the CAPTCHA, that website login test where you have to decipher the distorted image of a word. Or you have to find the traffic lights or fire hydrants in a grid of nine blurry photos. Those tests help to keep down the volume of spam, spyware, and misinformation; they advance the clarity of digitized books and the intelligence of self-driving cars; and, by the way, they made a handsome profit. The only problem: We HATE those tests!

Journalist and author David Pogue finds the untold creation stories behind the most mind-blowing advances in\u00a0science\u00a0and tech\u2014and hears from the characters involved\u2014from their first inspiration to the times they almost gave up. This episode looks at the bad guys who used software bots to sign up for millions of fake email accounts\u2014for sending out spam. Then, PhD student Luis Von Ahn stopped them. He invented the CAPTCHA, that website login test where you have to decipher the distorted image of a word. Or you have to find the traffic lights or fire hydrants in a grid of nine blurry photos. Those tests help to keep down the volume of spam, spyware, and misinformation; they advance the clarity of digitized books and the intelligence of self-driving cars; and, by the way, they made a handsome profit. The only problem: We HATE those tests!
