This allows for faster initial page load times and improved search engine optimization (SEO) while still retaining the benefits of a SPA. Currently, Angular performs hydration by destroying and rebuilding the entire DOM. This works, but it's not ideal. In this episode we welcome Ben Holmes to the show to learn about Astro.

If you haven't heard of Ionic, it's a set of components for rendering native controls on iOS and Android that enables web developers to build apps that are executed on phones and tablets that include core native device functionality. As web developers we are really good at creating applications that use a template (HTML) that is styled (CSS) and is dynamic and interactive (JS). If you think about it, that sounds like a lot of the apps that are available in Google Play and the App Store. Further, as Max points out, it's really about using the GPU to render bitmaps to the screen, which a webview is more than capable of doing. So, why not create the apps of today and the future using a stack like Angular and Ionic? <br /><br />In this episode, Max shares the history of how they got started with Ionic, from rebuilding Cordova and PhoneGap, to solving the developer experience using new tooling, building the component view library, and Capacitor, an open-source cross-platform native bridge built and supported by the Ionic team.",

If you haven't heard of Ionic, it's a set of components for rendering native controls on iOS and Android that enables web developers to build apps that are executed on phones and tablets that include core native device functionality. As web developers we are really good at creating applications that use a template (HTML) that is styled (CSS) and is dynamic and interactive (JS). If you think about it, that sounds like a lot of the apps that are available in Google Play and the App Store. Further, as Max points out, it's really about using the GPU to render bitmaps to the screen, which a webview is more than capable of doing. So, why not create the apps of today and the future using a stack like Angular and Ionic? <br /><br />In this episode, Max shares the history of how they got started with Ionic, from rebuilding Cordova and PhoneGap, to solving the developer experience using new tooling, building the component view library, and Capacitor, an open-source cross-platform native bridge built and supported by the Ionic team.",

Mike joins our panelists Aaron Frosts, Jennifer Wadella, and Brian Love, to chat about NgRx Effects best practices.<br /><br />NgRx is the defacto standard state management solution for Angular. While the core state module is highly inspired by Redux, the Effects library is unique to NgRx, and one of the best features of NgRx (in our humble opinion). NgRx Effects enable developers to perform side effects, like fetching data from an API, in an elegant and efficient manner. But, effects can also be tricky, hard to test, and sometimes it's not clear what RxJS operator is best suited for an effect.<br /><br />In this episode, we learn from Mike the best practices of using NgRx Effects, how to make them simpler, more maintainable, and easier to test. Plus, there are a handful of simple tips that you can walk away with and immediately improve the performance of your Angular application that is using NgRx Effects. Plus, if you've ever been unsure about which higher-order mapping operator (ya know, those somethingMap() ones) to use with an effect, Mike will break it all down for you in a straightforward way.

As Angular developers, we have several tools at our disposal to accomplish i18n and l10n. As you might expect, since Angular is an opinionated framework that comes with batteries included, there is a solution provided by the Angular Team. We recently sat down with Kaitlyn Ekdahl to learn about the built-in solution to i18n provided by Angular. Kaitlyn taught us how to get started, some of the recent improvements, as well as the pros and cons of this solution. We also briefly mentioned that there are a few open-source community-led efforts at solving i18n with Angular, such as ngx-translate and Transloco.<br /><br />As engineers, the panelists for the Angular Show (Aaron, Jennifer and Brian) are always curious. We want to learn more, and we endeavor to share our learnings with you! We were excited to learn more about Transloco from Inbal Sinai, a member of the ngneat team, and a Senior Front End Developer at Datorama Salesforce. Inbal shares with us how Transloco works, how easy it is to use, and some of the runtime advantages that Transloco provides. Transloco also makes it easy to get started using the provided `ng add` command. And, if you're currently using Angular's i18n library, Transloco has documentation on how you can easily switch. Oh, did we mention docs? Yeah, they have that covered too (and quite well we might add).<br /><br />If you are considering supporting i18n and l10n in your Angular application we recommend you listen to this episode of the Angular Show, check out Transloco, and don't forget to subscribe so you can go back and listen to the show we did with Kaitlyn to learn about Angular's localization library.<br /><br /><br />Show Notes:<br /><br /><a href=\"https://ngneat.github.io/transloco\" rel=\"noopener\">https://ngneat.github.io/transloco</a><br /><br />Connect with us:<br /><br />Inbal Sinai - @SinaiInbal<br />Brian F Love - @brian_love<br />Jennifer Wadella - @likeOMGitsFEDAY",

However, a SPA often requires sending large chunks of JavaScript code to the client. This code must be downloaded and parsed by the client, not to mention the execution time required. There are many strategies to achieve a highly performant single-page application. One of the most commonly used strategies is to lazy-load as much of the application as possible. It's likely that the client does _not_ need the entire application's code upfront, rather, we can deliver a minimal amount of code to the client to bootstrap the application.

Minko Gechev is a longtime contributor to Angular, a member of the Angular Team, a good friend of ours, and an all-around wonderful person to spend time with. To kick things off, Minko takes us through some of the big changes as part of the Angular version 12 release, including Ivy (no not the plant, the new-ish compilation and rendering pipeline in Angular) libraries and the final sail-off of ViewEngine (the thing that Ivy replaces), updates to the Language Service (VS Code plugin) to use Ivy, strict mode as the new default for new Angular projections, webpack 5 support, nullish coalescing operator in templates, and inline Sass. Phew!! That's a long list. I guess the team has been a bit busy. Hopefully, they got a break to attend Minko's amazing talk at Google I/O.<br /><br />And that's just the Angular version 12 content we cover in this episode! We also talk about DevTools, the new Chrome extension for Angular developers from the Angular Team, its features, how it works, the integration with the Chome DevTools, and how you should never touch an internal Angular API with three theta symbols (joking, but, seriously, no touchy)! The new DevTools are available in the Chrome Web Store to download and install today, and will soon be available for Firefox.<br /><br />Oh, we almost forgot! In the midst of all of these amazing technical accomplishments, the team snuck in some easy-peezy Tailwind CSS support for those of you that love to add dozens of classes to your HTML elements and are afraid of CSS (we get it, CSS is, like, really challenging). We're speculating that future versions of Angular might even write your CSS for you.<br /><br />Angular as a platform continues to grow and thrive. Want to be a part of the journey?

In this episode, the panelists have the pleasure to sit down with Ana Cidre, a Developer Advocate at Auth0, and learn about how she got started with being a part of, and building, communities. Ana shares a bit of her story about how she got started, was mentored by Sherry List, and began engaging with technical communities, the JavaScript community, and of course, the Angular Community. Ana's story is both inspiration and education, and we know you will enjoy this special episode from the Angular Show.<br /><br />Ana shares how being a DevRel is not about selling, rather, developer relations is about building tools and education so that developers will remember a specific product or solution when they need it. She also shares with us about the Avocado Labs initiative that she pioneers at Auth0. Avocado Labs provides educational online content for developers, focusing on frontend engineering technologies, and of course, security and identity management. Avocado Labs hosts online presentations and panels. They have upcoming events that you can sign up for, as well as recordings from past events.<br /><br />In a rift with Ana about online communities, our beloved panelist Brian proposes an (according to Jennifer \"cute\") community idea called \"async/await\" where attendees consume some educational online content asynchronously on your own, and then gather later in-person, or online, to discuss, ask questions, or have a panel. It's an idea, and you hear it here first. <br /><br />Finally, Ana shares with us the Auth0 Ambassador program, how it works, the perks, and more. You can learn more about the Ambassador program using a link in our show notes.<br /><br /><br />Show Notes:<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30121783-social-architecturehttps://avocadolabs.dev/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30121783-social-architecturehttps://avocadolabs.dev/</a><br />Links:<br /><a href=\"https://javascript-conference.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://javascript-conference.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshsimmons/status/1236060608153280513\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/joshsimmons/status/1236060608153280513</a> <br /><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation</a><br /><br />Connect with us:<br />Brian F Love - @brian_love<br />Jennifer Wadella - @likeOMGitsFEDAY<br />Ana Cidre - @AnaCidre_",

In this episode, the panelists have the pleasure to sit down with Ana Cidre, a Developer Advocate at Auth0, and learn about how she got started with being a part of, and building, communities. Ana shares a bit of her story about how she got started, was mentored by Sherry List, and began engaging with technical communities, the JavaScript community, and of course, the Angular Community. Ana's story is both inspiration and education, and we know you will enjoy this special episode from the Angular Show.<br /><br />Ana shares how being a DevRel is not about selling, rather, developer relations is about building tools and education so that developers will remember a specific product or solution when they need it. She also shares with us about the Avocado Labs initiative that she pioneers at Auth0. Avocado Labs provides educational online content for developers, focusing on frontend engineering technologies, and of course, security and identity management. Avocado Labs hosts online presentations and panels. They have upcoming events that you can sign up for, as well as recordings from past events.<br /><br />In a rift with Ana about online communities, our beloved panelist Brian proposes an (according to Jennifer \"cute\") community idea called \"async/await\" where attendees consume some educational online content asynchronously on your own, and then gather later in-person, or online, to discuss, ask questions, or have a panel. It's an idea, and you hear it here first. <br /><br />Finally, Ana shares with us the Auth0 Ambassador program, how it works, the perks, and more. You can learn more about the Ambassador program using a link in our show notes.<br /><br /><br />Show Notes:<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30121783-social-architecturehttps://avocadolabs.dev/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30121783-social-architecturehttps://avocadolabs.dev/</a><br />Links:<br /><a href=\"https://javascript-conference.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://javascript-conference.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshsimmons/status/1236060608153280513\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/joshsimmons/status/1236060608153280513</a> <br /><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation</a><br /><br />Connect with us:<br />Brian F Love - @brian_love<br />Jennifer Wadella - @likeOMGitsFEDAY<br />Ana Cidre - @AnaCidre_",

And, while databases may not be something you are familiar with or really have to even worry about, we wanted to take a break from our usual programming to reflect briefly on data persistence. After all, you need to put your user data somewhere, and we don't recommend stuffing everything into localStorage.<br /><br />In this episode, panelists Brian Love, Jennifer Wadella, and Aaron Frost welcome Oren Eini, founder of RavenDB, to the Angular Show. Oren teaches us about some of the key decisions around structured vs unstructured databases (or SQL vs NoSQL in hipster developer parlance). With the boom of document-driven unstructured databases, we wanted to learn why you might choose this technology, the pitfalls and benefits, and what are the options out there. Of course, Oren has a bit of a bias for RavenDB, so we'll learn what RavenDB is all about and why it might be a good solution for your Angular application.<br /><br />Show Notes<br /><a href=\"http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/nosql/\" rel=\"noopener\">http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/nosql/</a><br />Shadon: <a href=\"https://www.shodan.io/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.shodan.io/</a><br />Data Breaches: <a href=\"https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/</a><br />Israel COVID Stats: <a href=\"https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general\" rel=\"noopener\">https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general</a><br /><br />Connect with us:<br />Brian F Love - @brian_love<br />Aaron Frost - @aaronfrost<br />Jennifer Wadella - @likeOMGitsFEDAY<br />Oren Eini - @ayende",

And, while databases may not be something you are familiar with or really have to even worry about, we wanted to take a break from our usual programming to reflect briefly on data persistence. After all, you need to put your user data somewhere, and we don't recommend stuffing everything into localStorage.<br /><br />In this episode, panelists Brian Love, Jennifer Wadella, and Aaron Frost welcome Oren Eini, founder of RavenDB, to the Angular Show. Oren teaches us about some of the key decisions around structured vs unstructured databases (or SQL vs NoSQL in hipster developer parlance). With the boom of document-driven unstructured databases, we wanted to learn why you might choose this technology, the pitfalls and benefits, and what are the options out there. Of course, Oren has a bit of a bias for RavenDB, so we'll learn what RavenDB is all about and why it might be a good solution for your Angular application.<br /><br />Show Notes<br /><a href=\"http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/nosql/\" rel=\"noopener\">http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/nosql/</a><br />Shadon: <a href=\"https://www.shodan.io/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.shodan.io/</a><br />Data Breaches: <a href=\"https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/</a><br />Israel COVID Stats: <a href=\"https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general\" rel=\"noopener\">https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general</a><br /><br />Connect with us:<br />Brian F Love - @brian_love<br />Aaron Frost - @aaronfrost<br />Jennifer Wadella - @likeOMGitsFEDAY<br />Oren Eini - @ayende",

Infragistics is a design and development company that also builds tooling and products to enable developers to build robust applications in .NET and Angular. In this show, we welcome George Abraham and Konstantin Dinev back to the show to teach us about design systems and their low-code solution for Angular.<br /><br />We start out by learning about design systems and the importance of using a design system to integrate the UI/UX team with the development workflow. In many organizations, there is a gap between these two teams, and further, making feature iterations and scaling designs across many applications can be difficult and complex. Design systems seek to solve these issues. Infragistics Indigo Design is built with this purpose in mind.<br /><br />Infragistics' new App Builder build (see what we did there) on Indigo Design to provide a low-code solution for application prototyping and development. Imagine taking your UI design, building the design and navigation using their cloud solution, and then downloading the resulting Angular application that is ready to go. Now now, you might find this a bit scary being an Angular developer. But, have no fear, the panelists ask the tough questions for you, such as what about the quality, maintainability, and testability of the generated code?? We think you'll be pleasantly surprised to learn what the team at Infragistics is building.

The filtering operators enable developers to filter next notifications from an Observable.<br /><br />The most logical filtering operator to start with is, well, you guessed it, the filter() operator. From there, we look to the operators that only emit a single next notification: first(), last(), find(), and single(). Most of these operators are fairly straight-forward, and often have an optional predicate that can be provided to determine when the operator returns a new Observable that immediately emits the next notification to the Observer, or to the next operator in the pipe. Moving onward Lara teaches us about the family of take() and skip() operators. We didn't list them out here since we are lazy and don't want to type them all out, plus, you should really just have a listen to the show and subscribe! Ok, phew, now Lara and the panelists talk about the ignoreElement() operator, which like the window() operator, has nothing to do with the DOM. Rounding the final bend in our run through the filtering operators we talk about the family of distinct() operators. And, with a sprint to the finish line, we learn about the audit(), debounce() and simple() operators for rate limiting. Speaking of rate-limiting, this is getting long. But, thankfully, this show on the filtering operators is not that long, plus, you can always expect a good time hanging out with the Angular Show.

Inputs often come in the form of user events, and one of the primary methods for users to provide input into our applications is through forms. Whether you love or hate forms, web developers have no way of escaping this critical input method. <br /><br />In this episode of the Angular Show, our panelists are joined by two experts in the area of Angular and forms, Juri Strumpflohner and Bram Borggreve.

Securing your app is complex, constantly evolving, and is critical to your application.

You, your team, and your organization should prioritize what you know and do best: building your app.<br /><br />While there are many identity providers to choose from, Angular Show panelists Jeniffer Wadella and Brian Love wanted to learn more about the solution provided by Microsoft. So, we sat down with Christos Matskas from the Microsoft Identity Product Group to learn more.<br /><br />Microsoft Azure provides a robust infrastructure and tooling for securing Angular applications. And getting started only requires an Azure account and your existing knowledge of Angular. First, you register your Angular application, then you can configure your Angular application using the Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript. The Microsoft Identity Product Group team has also built a wrapper on top of the JS library specifically for Angular, making it very easy to install and import the necessary module into your Angular application's root module to configure your application. The team also provides plenty of source code examples in their documentation specific to Angular. Using Microsoft Identity platform, you can rest assured that your application is secure, and the security of your application is following best practices from security experts.<br /><br />Join us as we learn about the benefits of using an identity provider, the specific implementation of using Microsoft Azure identity solution with Angular, and how you can get started.

And, as you know, Angular leverages RxJS for cancelable asynchronous actions and events. In our opinion, the two are a perfect match. Interactions with web applications are asynchronous in nature and Angular provides a robust solution to detecting those asynchronous actions, enabling developers to build interactive experiences for the web with ease.<br /><br />In this series on RxJS operators, we help you learn the operators. As you likely know, there are a lot of them, and it can be difficult to know what each of them does, and often, how to determine which operator, or operators, are succinct and current for solving the complexities of streaming data, actions, and events in our applications.<br /><br />Join panelists Jennifer Wadella, Aaron Frost, Brian Love, and guest Jan-Niklas Wortmann as we explore the creation operators. These functions enable the creation of new observables, or the composing of existing observables into a new observable stream.

In this episode, panelists Aaron Frost, Brian Love, and Jennifer Wadella are 'buzzing' with details on MobX, Akita, and NGXS. <br /><br />All three of these solutions can be used in Angular, are open-source, and are free to use. MobX is widely used with React, perhaps the second favorite after redux, for state management. Akita, from the team at Datarama, takes a slightly different approach from the redux pattern for providing a state management solution. Akita is popular within the Angular community, but can also be used with both React and Svelte projections. Finally, NGXS is inspired by redux and NgRx and makes heavy use of TypeScript decorators to achieve similar goals as NgRx with a potential lower code cost.<br /><br />Join us in part 5 of our series on state management in Angular and come along with the panelists and learn about various solutions that you might want to consider for your Angular application.",

In this episode, panelists Aaron Frost, Brian Love, and Jennifer Wadella are 'buzzing' with details on MobX, Akita, and NGXS. <br /><br />All three of these solutions can be used in Angular, are open-source, and are free to use. MobX is widely used with React, perhaps the second favorite after redux, for state management. Akita, from the team at Datarama, takes a slightly different approach from the redux pattern for providing a state management solution. Akita is popular within the Angular community, but can also be used with both React and Svelte projections. Finally, NGXS is inspired by redux and NgRx and makes heavy use of TypeScript decorators to achieve similar goals as NgRx with a potential lower code cost.<br /><br />Join us in part 5 of our series on state management in Angular and come along with the panelists and learn about various solutions that you might want to consider for your Angular application.",

That's right, there was no way we could fit the topic into a single episode. <br /><br />Panelists Aaron Frost, Brian Love, and Jennifer Wadella start with defining what exactly is \"state\" in a client application and why it matters. We then jump into a time machine and travel back to the (good?) ole' days of state management in AngularJS. Remember $scope? What about those long digest cycles? But, have no fear, we'll then race forward in time to the pending release of the modern-framework that is Angular (version 2+).<br /><br />The panelists then welcome Googler Alex Rickabaugh to share how he made his way onto the Angular Team through an internal data fetching/caching project called Streamy. His experience with building Streamy led to working on a PoC Angular project, \"Tactical\", in an attempt to provide Angular with a State Management+ solution.  Tactical aimed to manage data flow, offline, validation, caching, conflicts, and more. While Tactical was never released as an official part of the Angular platform, Alex shares insight into the complexities of state management and building abstract tools to solve the oft-encountered programming problem.<br /><br />But wait, wait... there's more. The panelists then scrub forward in time to hearing about state management evolutions in other frameworks, such as Flux and then Redux. Then, zooming forward even more into the land of Promises and then the revelation (and struggle) of Observables.  With all that history and information, you definitely don't want to miss this episode! Come join us on the journey, and definitely don't forget to subscribe to stay caught up on all our future episodes as well!<br /><br />Alex Rickabaugh: @synalx",

That's right, there was no way we could fit the topic into a single episode. <br /><br />Panelists Aaron Frost, Brian Love, and Jennifer Wadella start with defining what exactly is \"state\" in a client application and why it matters. We then jump into a time machine and travel back to the (good?) ole' days of state management in AngularJS. Remember $scope? What about those long digest cycles? But, have no fear, we'll then race forward in time to the pending release of the modern-framework that is Angular (version 2+).<br /><br />The panelists then welcome Googler Alex Rickabaugh to share how he made his way onto the Angular Team through an internal data fetching/caching project called Streamy. His experience with building Streamy led to working on a PoC Angular project, \"Tactical\", in an attempt to provide Angular with a State Management+ solution.  Tactical aimed to manage data flow, offline, validation, caching, conflicts, and more. While Tactical was never released as an official part of the Angular platform, Alex shares insight into the complexities of state management and building abstract tools to solve the oft-encountered programming problem.<br /><br />But wait, wait... there's more. The panelists then scrub forward in time to hearing about state management evolutions in other frameworks, such as Flux and then Redux. Then, zooming forward even more into the land of Promises and then the revelation (and struggle) of Observables.  With all that history and information, you definitely don't want to miss this episode!

Weighing the benefits with the cost is critical and should not be missed in your organization or team.<br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe so you can be notified when Testing Series Part 2 on using Jest for unit testing in Angular is available for download!",

But, one of the first things she noticed in tech, was that it was mostly men. She decided to co-found a women-in-tech coding group in Syracuse, NY to teach other women about technology, coding, and the web. You might be wondering, why are there women-specific groups?
