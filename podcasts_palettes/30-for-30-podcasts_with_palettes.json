Generations of gymnasts trained at their isolated ranch outside of Houston, where the Karolyis were champion-making teachers to some and tormentors to others. In front of the cameras, Bela was the bear-hugging motivator who pushed his athletes to the limit and Martha was the silent partner who demanded perfection. From the 1970s through the 1990s, the Karolyis coached some of the greatest names in the sport, from Nadia Comaneci to Mary Lou Retton and Kerri Strug. The couple then took over the U.S. national team program that featured Olympic champions like Carly Patterson and Simone Biles. Few dared challenge the Karolyis\u2019 coaching methods, and those who did were ignored or ostracized.

Six Who Sat tells the story of two iconic moments in women's running, both captured in photographs. The first, from 1968, is of a race director trying to physically restrain a woman from running the Boston Marathon. The second, from 1972, is of a protest at the New York City Marathon that forever changed women's ability to participate in the sport they loved.
