In the midst of a rash of mid-1990s church burnings across the United States, White\u2019s Inner City Church boasts a growing interracial congregation, and after the building is firebombed and reduced to ashes, White believes the attack is the work of racists. The NFL legend and pastor uses his platform to maintain public pressure on the investigation, even as the sensitive nature of the crime causes government officials to tread carefully. As the story unfolds, questions are raised about the church\u2019s financial status, along with the possibility of arson. The podcast brings the story to life through the voices of those involved with the church and the investigation \u2013 and in the process, draws a powerful parallel between these ugly incidents and the deeper challenges the nation still faces.\n30 for 30 Podcasts and Andscape present Through the Flames: Reggie's Church.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
