When Desiray was down, Aaron always cheered her up. When she needed him, his music was always there. And when they finally met, it was almost as if Aaron could read her mind. Maybe the deep, human connection Desiray felt as a kid was real. Dozens of concerts later, Desiray and Aaron are almost friends \u2014 almost. Now Desiray wonders: \u201cCan a fan ever be a true friend?\u201d Does Aaron value her as a friend, or as a fan? And if she\u2019s just a fan like any other, can she live with it?\n\n\nThis story was produced by Galen Koch in collaboration with The Heart.

Queer fur trappers, stagecoach drivers, European explorers, and poets, like Clark, made their way out west looking for the freedom of a new context.

It\u2019s a lot harder to be a woman who\u2019s hairier, wider, bigger, taller, square instead of round, straight up and down instead of curvy, big hands, big feet, no vagina and maybe no breasts either. A woman who isn\u2019t quite looking like what some people think a woman should look like. But who is finding her way.\n\n\nTo these women, the world can be downright cruel. More than cruel, violent. Harassment often escalates into assault, and more often than you would like to hear, escalates into full on homicide.\n\n\nFor these women, being womanly in the way we are told we have to is sometimes about more than beauty. It\u2019s about survival. This episode is about the story of one woman\u2019s quest for beauty.\n\n\nIt was a collaboration with badass poet and radio maker, Julia Alsop. After we finished production we invited Zil Goldstein into my walk-in closet magic sound booth to talk through some of the blind spots in the story. Zil is a nurse practitioner, working specifically to help medical providers be more LGBT aware.\n\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about the disproportionate amount of violence that trans women face the<a href=\"http://www.avp.org/storage/documents/2012_mr_ncavp_hvreport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">National Coalition Against Violence Project</a> puts out a yearly report.",
