            "description": "ABC News Daily is the podcast that helps you understand the issues affecting your world. Every episode, host Samantha Hawley walks through one story with the help of an ABC colleague or expert in under 15 minutes. When you want coverage you can trust, listen to ABC News Daily.\n\nKey topics of recent episodes include the US presidential election, Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, polling, charges against Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs, coal power, renewable energy, Chinese EVs, cybersecurity, BYD, electric vehicles, Israel, Iran, Lebanon and war in the Middle East.\n\nFrom interest rates, real estate and the housing crisis, to scams and the US election, ABC News Daily brings you facts and analysis you need to understand the biggest news stories.\n\nThe podcast covers news from America, with analysis on what the race for the White House means for the future of US democracy. The fate of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have big implications for global politics and security and US journalists and experts will explain what's at stake.\n\nAs Australians battle a cost-of-living crisis, ABC News Daily looks at the causes of inflation, rising rental costs, house prices, insurance costs and the price of groceries. Key experts in business and finance join Samantha Hawley, explaining the state of the economy, the unemployment rate and the jobs market.\n\nWhether you rent, own an investment house or apartment, or are repaying a mortgage, ABC News Daily offers unique insights and analysis. When there are big moves from the Reserve Bank (RBA) on interest rates, or remarkable reactions in the ASX or the Australian dollar, guest experts, including economists, explain why.\n\nExpect regular updates on Australian politics, with key comments from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton. The podcast picks apart major policy areas, including energy policy, finance and the Federal Budget.\n\nLook into ABC News Daily's archive to find episodes on electric vehicles (EVs), artificial intelligence (AI), the big banks, supermarkets, TikTok, Ozempic, Tesla, Elon Musk, Twitter, Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, COVID, cyber security, spies, espionage, education, schools, teachers, crime and issues relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (First Nations) Australians.\n\nABC News Daily follows developments in the Middle East and the war between Israel and Hamas, with insights into the mindset of Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinians and the role of Iran.\n\nThe podcast looks at the latest from Ukraine as Volodymyr Zelensky fights to repel the Russian invaders led by Russia's President Vladimir Putin. As China's Xi Jinping contemplates the future of Taiwan, ABC News Daily will sort fact from fiction. When North Korea's Kim Jong Un fires ballistic missiles, we'll assess the danger his regime poses.\n\nWhen scammers target superannuation, your tax return and the ATO, you'll hear advice on what you can do to protect yourself.\n\nAs climate change fuelled by greenhouse gas emissions increases the risk of natural disasters, including fires and floods, ABC News Daily brings you fact-based analysis.\n\nThe future of electricity generation in Australia is being debated, and as claims are made about the merits of nuclear power, come to ABC News Daily for context around its potential role in replacing or augmenting coal and gas power plants and what it could mean for power bills. The podcast covers the future of renewable / green power generation, including the use of wind turbines, solar and hydro electric power.\n\nThe podcast looks at key businesses, including Coles and Woolworths, Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank and the construction, resources and manufacturing industries. When they report record profit, battle unions, or raise prices, the podcast pays attention.\n\nABC experts including Ian Verrender, Alan Kohler, Laura Tingle, Patricia Karvelas, John Lyons, and Annabel Crabb join Samantha Hawley to step through big issues and current affairs.",
