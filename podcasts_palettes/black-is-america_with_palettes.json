Join us as we shed new light on lost chapters in our nation's history. Hear the amazing, inspiring accounts of black American inventors, heroes, scientists, entrepreneurs and so much more. \n\nWhile racism is a common theme, it is not the central theme. These stories focus instead on what black people have contributed in spite of it, and the impact of those contributions shows clearly that African American History is American History."
