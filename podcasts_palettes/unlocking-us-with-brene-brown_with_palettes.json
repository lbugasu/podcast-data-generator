    "description": "I\u2019ve spent over 20 years studying the emotions and experiences that bring meaning and purpose to our lives, and if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s this: we are hardwired for connection, and connecting requires courage, vulnerability, and conversation. I want this to be a podcast that\u2019s real, unpolished, honest, and reflects both the magic and the messiness of what it means to be human. Episodes will include conversations with the people who are teaching me, challenging me, confusing me, or maybe even ticking me off a little. I'll also have direct conversations with you about what I\u2019m learning from new research, and we'll do some episodes dedicated to answering your questions. We don\u2019t have to do life alone. We were never meant to.\nPart of the Vox Media Podcast Network.",

You may remember Karen from a two-part podcast we did last year on her book The Lightmaker\u2019s Manifesto, which is all about working for change without losing your joy. And I literally just called her and said, \u201cWill you be on the podcast this week, because I\u2019m in such deep struggle and I can\u2019t access any joy? I feel guilty if I\u2019m happy about something because the world is such a shit show right now and people are in so much pain.\u201d If you\u2019re struggling with how to be fully connected in your life and feel joy and acknowledge beauty and also fight for the things that we need to fight for right now, this will be a great podcast for you.

I want this to be a podcast that\u2019s real, unpolished, honest, and reflects both the magic and the messiness of what it means to be human. Episodes will include conversations with the people who are teaching me, challenging me, confusing me, or maybe even ticking me off a little. I'll also have direct conversations with you about what I\u2019m learning from new research, and we'll do some episodes dedicated to answering your questions. We don\u2019t have to do life alone. We were never meant to.\nPart of the Vox Media Podcast Network."
