She published 11 novels and is the recipient of a Pulitzer, a Nobel and a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Sula and Beloved are just a few of her works that are considered great American classics. \r\n\r\nBefore she was a celebrated author, she was a pioneering editor at Random House, opening doors for a whole generation of Black writers, including Angela Davis, Huey P. Newton and Gayl Jones. Her editorship assembled a strong network of the most prominent Black intellectuals of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nBut Toni Morrison\u2019s road to success was not a straight shot. She only published her first novel around 40 years old. And when she found her footing, she changed the face of American literature.\r\n\r\nOn the Making season finale, host Brandon Pope sits down with leading Toni Morrison scholars, including Dana Williams, Carolyn Denard, Autumn Womack and Courtney Thorsson, to unpack the trajectory of an American literary hero.\r\n\r\nMaking tells the story of a different, iconic figure every episode.

I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to die because I got a bad heart\u2026I believe that I will be able to die as a revolutionary in the international revolutionary proletarian struggle.\u201d - Fred Hampton, 1969\r\n\r\nFred Hampton became the Chairman of the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party when he was just years out of high school. His oratory talent and intellectual grasp on leftist literature quickly shot him to stardom in activist circles. But, his leadership did not last long. In 1969, when he was just 21 years old, he was assassinated during a raid on his home orchestrated by the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, the Chicago Police Department and the FBI.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knew the power and potential of Fred Hampton,\u201d former Congressman Bobby Rush said of the FBI Director at the time. \u201cSo I\u2019m telling you, the man was nothing but greatness.\u201d\r\n\r\nToday, in a special Black History Month episode of Making, in collaboration with The Rundown podcast, we tell the story of iconic Chicago liberation activist, Fred Hampton. Our hosts Brandon Pope and Erin Allen sat down with original members of the Black Panther Party, attorneys who fought his post-assassination lawsuits in the 1960s and family members who carry on his legacy.\r\n\r\nMaking tells the story of a different, iconic figure every episode.

But before Caged Bird, Angelou danced and sang on and off Broadway, earned the moniker \u201cMiss Calypso\u201d in the 1950s, called dozens of American cities and African nations home, and even became the first Black woman to work as a cable car conductor in San Francisco. \r\n\r\nOn this episode of Making, host Brandon Pope sits down with Rita Coburn, co-director of the Peabody-Award-winning PBS documentary Maya Angelou: And Still I Rise; Randal Jelks, professor of African and African American studies and American studies at the University of Kansas; and Dr. Maxine Mimms, the founder of the Tacoma Campus of Evergreen State College and a longtime friend of Angelou.\r\n\r\n\u201cHer main word was courage,\u201d Dr. Mimms said, \u201cThe courage to love, the courage to walk, the courage to move.\u201d\r\n\r\nMaking tells the story of a different, iconic figure every episode.

Eight months after those famous words, he became the youngest MVP in NBA history.\r\n\r\nDerrick Rose was Chicago\u2019s pride and joy. Fans and journalists alike called him the next Michael Jordan. Some thought he would be the greatest of all time. When an ACL tear took him out of the game, those high hopes turned to high scrutiny.\r\n\r\nOn this episode of Making, host Brandon Pope explores the years before Derrick Rose changed the NBA. He grew up in the South Side neighborhood of Englewood, raised by a loving mother and three protective older brothers. By his sophomore year of high school, his talent and name was known across the city. We chatted with his high school coach who shaped his rise, veteran Chicago journalists who traced his steps, and Bulls insiders who witnessed his history-making.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe'll forever be one of the greatest basketball players to come out of the city,\u201d NBC Chicago host Jason Goff said. \u201cI make no bones about it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMaking tells the story of a different, iconic figure every episode.

She wrote about the experience in her local church newspaper.\r\n\r\n\u201cI felt that one had better die fighting against injustice than to die like a dog or a rat in a trap,\u201d she said later.\r\n\r\nWells would soon become one of America\u2019s greatest journalism pioneers. After the lynching of her close friend, she investigated the prevalence of lynchings across the American South. She collected data, interviewed sources on the ground and wrote fiery articles that dispelled racist myths. By the end of the campaign, she was one of the most famous Black women in America.\r\n\r\nWhile her force can be felt over a century later, in her time Wells faced backlash from the white and Black community alike. She co-founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \u2013 or NAACP \u2013 in 1909, but was temporarily ousted for being too radical.\r\n\r\n\u201cDoing good journalism actually means that you're not making any friends,\u201d said journalist Caitlin Dickerson, who wrote Wells\u2019 obituary for The New York Times series Overlooked. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad sign if there's one group of people who think of you as \u2018on their side.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the latest episode of Making, host Brandon Pope leads a conversation with Dickerson, Wells\u2019 great-granddaughter Michelle Duster and acclaimed scholar Paula Giddings, author of Ida: A Sword Among Lions, on the life and legacy of this journalism and civil rights hero.",

By the show\u2019s finale in 2011, it was aired in 145 countries and watched by more than 40 million viewers a week in the U.S. alone. Today\u2019s daytime hosts like Ellen and Dr. Oz? They now average only about a tenth of that. If Oprah mentioned a book title, it became a best-seller. She landed the interviews that no one else could get. Her message of spirituality and empowerment influenced millions. With an hourlong daytime TV show, Oprah built a powerful brand. She made billions. And, as CNN, USA Today, Forbes and Time Magazine all proclaimed, she became the most powerful woman in America. In the first of a three-part podcast series, Oprah and former producers talk with WBEZ's Jenn White about the early, scrappy days of the program.&nbsp;Phil Donahue reflects on Oprah's entry into the daytime talk landscape that he once dominated.&nbsp;Plus, the podcast revisits milestones from the 1980s, like the show's national debut, and some mixed feelings over the show's highest-rated episode ever.",
