This week, she tells the story of their life as hostages in Gaza.\n\n\nPrologue: The 251 hostages taken by Hamas a year ago have become a divisive symbol in Israel. Host Ira Glass talks about the father of one hostage, and what happened to him at a protest last week when he called for a hostage deal.\u00a0(6 minutes)\n\nPart One: On this week\u2019s show, we\u2019re airing excerpts of interviews with former hostages produced by an Israeli podcast, Echad Bayom. In these interviews they describe, in a remarkably detailed and complicated way, what happened to them a year ago.\u00a0\n\nPart Two: Chen\u2019s story continues, with a description of what it was like to be hidden in a small apartment with her children and their captors. (6 minutes)\n\nPart Three: Chen talks about the complicated relationship between her family and the people holding them hostage.\u00a0(6 minutes)\n\nPart Four: Chen describes hearing the Israeli news while in captivity, including one night when her own father was interviewed. (4 minutes)\n\nPart Five: Chen talks about what it was like to walk around the streets of Gaza in disguise and their eventual release, 51 days after they were taken from their home.\u00a0(13 minutes)",
