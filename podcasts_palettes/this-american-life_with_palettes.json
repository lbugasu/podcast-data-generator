This week, we bring you the extraordinary story of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who created the only verifiable public record of votes in their presidential election \u2014 and other stories of people trying to correct the official record with their own versions.\n\n\nPrologue: Host Ira Glass sets us up for Nancy Updike\u2019s insider account of the\u00a0recent presidential election in Venezuela. The story is an incredible national drama that plays out in thousands of polling stations across the country, with regular people trying to ensure a fair vote count that everyone can agree on. (2 minutes)\n\nAct One: Producer Nancy Updike tells the story of the people of Venezuela trying to prove who won their recent presidential election beyond a shadow of a doubt.\u00a0(22 minutes)\n\nAct Two: Host Ira Glass spent America\u2019s presidential election in the swing state of Michigan, where he found very little dispute over the ballot count from Republican poll challengers in Detroit\u00a0now that they are doing the counting themselves.\u00a0(8 minutes)\n\nAct Three: This story is about a creepy and dangerous creature that does all kinds of terrible things. It\u2019s also about someone trying to set the record straight on those exact assumptions about this notorious creature.\u00a0(9 minutes)",
