The list books were like the internet, before the internet. (12 minutes)\n\nAct One: John Fecile talks to his brother, Pat, about a list their other brother made before he died. They each have different ideas about what the list means and how they feel about it.\u00a0(14 minutes)\n\nAct 2: A brief visit with Bobby, who keeps a list in his phone of all the dogs in his neighborhood and their names\u00a0to save him from the awkwardness of not knowing the name of someone\u2019s dog \u2013 because people get upset if you don\u2019t remember their dog\u2019s name. (3 minutes)\n\nAct Two: Reporter Masha Gessen talks to Russians living in America and elsewhere, about lists they\u2019ve been put on by the Russian government in the last few years. Masha is also on one of these lists. Each list has its own complex rules and potential consequences, for the people on the lists and for their family members who live in Russia. (28 minutes)"

                "summary": "Even when you're not trying to get one over on someone, it can be useful to keep the truth to yourself. Or conversely, to not know why people are lying to your face all the time. This week we'll tell you the whole truth about not telling the whole truth. Including the story of a guy who learned to lie for the first time in his life at age 29.\n\n\nIra talks with a guy in Chicago named Josh who likes to spend time going bird watching. But one day, \r\nJosh was out in a park with his binoculars and he discovered something he definitely did not want to \r\nknow about. (6 minutes)\n\nAct One: Michael Leviton was raised in a family who encouraged him and his siblings to tell the truth all the time. They believed it was better to be honest and work things out. Even when it was uncomfortable. But as Michael tells Ira, when he became an adult, he discovered that the world his parents created had its limitations. (19 minutes)\n\nAct Two: Producer Zoe Chace tells the story of a community college student named Demetrius who seemed like he was doing exceptionally well in school. But as Zoe followed Demetrius over a semester, she discovered that there were things about his academic past that he had kept a secret. And not just from her. (20 minutes)\n\nAct Three: Growing up, producer Stephanie Foo was the favorite child of her family in Malaysia. Particularly of the matriarch of the family who everyone called \"Auntie.\" But as an adult, Stephanie found out the complicated truth about why she was the family favorite. (13 minutes)"
