For some people, that was a hopeful thing. For others, kind of the opposite. This week, we talked with people who helped make it happen and some who are looking to what\u2019s next.\n\n\n\n\nPrologue: Ira talks with Zoe Chace about watching Trump\u2019s victory from an ecstatic room in Michigan. Then he checks in with\u00a0a DC cop who was injured at the Capitol on January 6. (7 minutes)\n\nAct One: Trump has claimed that he will be able to deport between 15 and 20 million people. But neither he nor\u00a0his team have spelled out exactly how they\u2019d do it. Producer Nadia Reiman looked into what mass deportation could actually look like on the ground if and when it comes to pass.\u00a0(17 minutes)\n\nAct Two: Trump won record numbers of Latino voters this year. Ike Sriskandarajah spent the day with a guy in Pennsylvania who's been working to bring Latino voters to Trump for years.\u00a0(15 minutes)\n\nAct Three: Ira talks with two of Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical enemies\u201d about their post-election plans.\u00a0(8 minutes)\n\nAct Four: Ten different states had abortion rights measures on their ballots this election. Producer Miki Meek got curious about a particular kind of political ad that aired in many of those states and called up a few of the women whose stories were featured in them.\u00a0(9 minutes)",
