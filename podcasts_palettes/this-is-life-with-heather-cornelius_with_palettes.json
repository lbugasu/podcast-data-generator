                    "itunes:summary": "In today\u2019s inaugural Season two episode, Lauren is inviting on psychotherapist and New York Times bestselling author of Maybe You Should Talk to Someone, Lori Gottlieb! The two dive in right away as Lauren asks Lori if she always envisioned being a counselor and how to create incredible connections with others through storytelling and music. The pair also chat about: what Lori believes drives the narrative of isolation, Lauren\u2019s personal story with counseling and mental health, how to identify what \u2018wise compassion\u2019 is, the difference between productive anxiety vs unproductive anxiety, and exactly where to start to breed more compassion. If you\u2019re ready to understand a little more about yourself, and those around you, to ultimately cultivate deeper relationships - this episode is for you. In addition to her clinical practice, Lori writes The Atlantic\u2019s weekly \u201cDear Therapist\u201d advice column and is co-host of the popular \u201cDear Therapists\u201d podcast produced by Katie Couric.
