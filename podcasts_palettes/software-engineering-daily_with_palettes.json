            "content:encodedSnippet": "In 79 AD, in the ancient Roman town of Herculaneum, twenty meters of hot mud and ash buried an enormous villa once owned by the father-in-law of Julius Caesar. Inside, there was a vast library of papyrus scrolls.\nThe scrolls were carbonized by the heat of the volcanic debris, but they were trapped underground where they remained preserved.\nIt wasn\u2019t until the 1750s that the scrolls were discovered, but they were fragile and resistant to being opened and read.\nThen, in 2015, researchers used X-ray tomography and computer vision to virtually unwrap the scrolls.\nLast year, the Vesuvius Challenge was launched by Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, and Brent Seales to crowdsource the process of reconstructing the text from the scrolls.\nJuli Schilliger and Youssef Nader are two members from the winning team. They join the show to talk about the computational approaches they used to reconstruct the scroll text.\nFor interested listeners, the 2024 Vesuvius Challenge is now live, with new challenges and prizes.
