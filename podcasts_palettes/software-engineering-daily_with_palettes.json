They did this very well for the long era of monolithic applications running in dedicated, single-server environments. However, their design presented a problem when the paradigm changed to distributed applications in the cloud. This shift eventually ushered in the rise of distributed SQL databases. One of the most prominent is CockroachDB, which uses a distributed architecture inspired by Google\u2019s Spanner. But what were the engineering approaches that made this architecture possible?\nJordan Lewis is a Senior Director of Engineering at CockroachDB Cloud. He joins the show to talk about the design of CockroachDB and how it works under the hood.\nThis episode is hosted by Lee Atchison.

Think of something as simple as cooking dinner. First you look up a recipe, then you write down the ingredients you need, you go shopping, and then you cook. These steps must be run in a certain order, and the state of the workflow must be tracked throughout. Workflow management is everywhere in the software world, and today it\u2019s common for teams to engineer custom solutions. This makes sense, because creating a general-purpose solution for workflow management is a hard conceptual problem, and perhaps an even harder engineering challenge.\nMaxim Fateev has a deep background engineering distributed systems and workflow management services at Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. In 2015, he joined Uber and helped create the open-source project, Cadence, which is an orchestration engine to execute asynchronous long-running business logic. The success of Cadence led Max to co-found Temporal, which is an open-source programming package for workflow execution. Max joins the show today to talk about the engineering challenges at Temporal, the concept of \u201cdurable execution\u201d, how he organizes his engineering teams, and more.\nSean\u2019s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler. He has published works covering a wide range of topics from information visualization to quantum computing. Currently, Sean is Head of Marketing and Developer Relations at Skyflow and host of the podcast Partially Redacted, a podcast about privacy and security engineering. You can connect with Sean on Twitter @seanfalconer.\n\nPlease click here to see the transcript for this episode.\n\nSponsorship inquiries:\u00a0sponsor@softwareengineeringdaily.com\nThe post Temporal with Max Fateev appeared first on Software Engineering Daily.",
