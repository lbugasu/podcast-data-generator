            "content:encodedSnippet": "Producing 3D films, games and simulations is a complex process, often involving multiple teams and tools. At Pixar, pipeline engineers needed to write lots of glue code to integrate different workflows and file formats, which was a big challenge, and led them to create the \u00a0Universal Scene Description, or OpenUSD. OpenUSD implements abstract data models for producing 3D worlds, and is now an open-source project.\nMaking full use of OpenUSD required a software framework. This motivated NVIDIA to create Omniverse, which is a modular development platform that enables individuals and teams to develop OpenUSD-based 3D workflows and applications.\nAaron Luk is the Director of Product Management for Omniverse, and was previously a software engineer at Pixar where he helped create OpenUSD. Aaron joins the show to talk about the origins of the technology, how it works, digital twins, industry impacts, and more.\nTo learn more about OpenUSD, check out the resources below:\nOpenUSD Day at NVIDIA GTC: https://nvda.ws/3wsFJMg\nAlliance for OpenUSD: https://nvda.ws/47Ro26n\nFull Disclosure: NVIDIA is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily\n\u00a0\nSean\u2019s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler.

Think of something as simple as cooking dinner. First you look up a recipe, then you write down the ingredients you need, you go shopping, and then you cook. These steps must be run in a certain order, and the state of the workflow must be tracked throughout. Workflow management is everywhere in the software world, and today it\u2019s common for teams to engineer custom solutions. This makes sense, because creating a general-purpose solution for workflow management is a hard conceptual problem, and perhaps an even harder engineering challenge.\nMaxim Fateev has a deep background engineering distributed systems and workflow management services at Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. In 2015, he joined Uber and helped create the open-source project, Cadence, which is an orchestration engine to execute asynchronous long-running business logic. The success of Cadence led Max to co-found Temporal, which is an open-source programming package for workflow execution. Max joins the show today to talk about the engineering challenges at Temporal, the concept of \u201cdurable execution\u201d, how he organizes his engineering teams, and more.\nSean\u2019s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler. He has published works covering a wide range of topics from information visualization to quantum computing. Currently, Sean is Head of Marketing and Developer Relations at Skyflow and host of the podcast Partially Redacted, a podcast about privacy and security engineering. You can connect with Sean on Twitter @seanfalconer.\n\nPlease click here to see the transcript for this episode.\n\nSponsorship inquiries:\u00a0sponsor@softwareengineeringdaily.com\nThe post Temporal with Max Fateev appeared first on Software Engineering Daily.",
