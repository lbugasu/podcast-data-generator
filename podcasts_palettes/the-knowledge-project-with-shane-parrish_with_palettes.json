                "summary": "<p>Most families who obtain immense wealth squander it by the third generation. But Chris Davis comes from a family whose grandfather and father all became independently wealthy of each other, and Davis has done the same.\u00a0How does that keep happening? In this conversation, we find out.<br /> <br /> Shane and Chris discuss life and investment lessons he learned from his father and grandfather, why writing is more important to clarify one's thinking no matter who's reading it, and the surprising benefit of reading physical newspapers and wearing ties to work. Davis also shares his value-investing philosophy, what he learned from working with and meeting Charlie Munger, and what parents can do to raise kids who aren't entitled. Davis talks about his alcohol drink tracker and why it's important to him, why he never puts himself in situations where envy can grow, and the insights from Warren Buffett's key letter about why investment managers underperform.<br /> <br /> Chris Davis is on the board of Berkshire Hathaway and The Coca-Cola Company. Davis is Chairman of Davis Selected Advisers-NY, Inc., an independent investment management firm founded in 1969. Davis joined Davis Selected Advisers-NY, Inc. in 1989 as a financial analyst, and in 1995, he became a portfolio manager of the firm\u2019s flagship funds.</p> <p><strong>Watch the episode on YouTube</strong>: https://www.youtube.com/c/theknowledgeproject/videos</p> <p><strong>Newsletter</strong> - I share timeless insights and ideas you can use at work and home.

Here are a few of the things we discuss:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn once and for all how to pronounce Stratechery. :)</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Ben\u2019s business model was developed and how he massaged it over the years to become what it is today</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The one metric Ben looks at each day to gauge the health of his business</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Ben deals with people who rip off his work and pass it off as their own</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben\u2019s thoughts on pricing, free trials, content and other important aspects of online membership sites</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Ben structures his day to churn out such incredible content so consistently</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Ben handles being wrong on his site, and his process for screening his work for confirmation bias</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How the internet has changed the traditional view of supply and demand, and what companies should do about it</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Ben would teach an MBA class about internet strategy (if you do</span> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business online, you need to hear this)</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What it would take for a start-up to overtake Google or Apple, and the vulnerabilities that all companies share, no matter how big or profitable</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new era of technology and how companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and Amazon are doing it right (and what you can do in your own business to take full advantage)</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the most jam-packed interviews I\u2019ve done on the Knowledge Project. Ben\u2019s answers are so thoughtful and informative that you\u2019re going to want to have a notebook handy.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Go Premium:</strong> Members get early access, ad-free episodes, hand-edited transcripts, searchable transcripts, member-only episodes, and more.

On this episode, I am thrilled to have Annie Duke, former professional poker player and author of the new book, <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074DG9LQF/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B074DG9LQF&linkId=5367e389670dadeff27cddca33c4cf0f\"> Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts</a>.</p> <p>Annie has a very interesting background that makes her uniquely qualified to speak about high-level decision making.

(As a bonus, Robert shares a few ways you can <em>improve</em> your bullshitting skills when it becomes necessary)</li> </ul> <p>And a lot more.</p> <p>Plus, Robert gives us a sneak peek into his newest project, <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525428143/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0525428143&linkId=bc31f00ce3932d7ae8a3ddf355bfcd99\"> <em>The Laws of Human Nature</em></a><em>,</em> which explores the hidden motivations that drive what we do and say.</p> <p>This interview is packed to the brim with interesting and actionable insights that I think you\u2019re going to love.

                "summary": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On this episode of the Knowledge Project, I\u2019m joined by the fascinating Dan Ariely. Dan just about does it all. He has delivered 6 TED talks with a combined 20 million views, he\u2019s a multiple New York Times best-selling author, a widely published researcher, and the James B Duke Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the better part of three decades, Dan has been immersed in researching why humans do some of the silly, irrational things we do. And yes, as much as we\u2019d all like to be exempt, that includes you too.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this captivating interview, we tackle a lot of interesting topics, including:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three types of decisions that control our life and how understanding our biases can help us make smarter decisions</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How our environment plays a big role in our decision making and the small changes we can make to automatically improve our outcomes</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The \u201cbehavioural driven\u201d bathroom scale Dan has been working on to revolutionize weight loss</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which of our irrational behaviors transfer across cultures and which ones are unique to certain parts of the world (for example, find out which country is the most honest)</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dishonesty spectrum and why we as humans insist on flirting with the line between \u201chonest\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 sneaky mental tricks Dan uses to avoid making ego-driven decisions</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPluralistic ignorance\u201d and how it dangerously affects our actions and inactions (As a bonus, Dan shares the hilarious way he demonstrates this concept to his students on their first day of class)</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rule Dan created specifically for people with spinach in their teeth</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference between habits, rules, and rituals, and why they are critical to shaping us into who we want to be</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a riveting discussion and one that easily could have gone for hours. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how you\u2019d respond in any of these eye-opening experiments, you have to listen to this interview. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll learn something new about yourself, whether you want to or not. \u00a0</span></p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Go Premium:</strong> Members get early access, ad-free episodes, hand-edited transcripts, searchable transcripts, member-only episodes, and more.
