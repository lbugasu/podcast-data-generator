From mismatched tattoos and injured ankles, Ryan reflects on the lessons he\u2019s learned about preparation, awareness, and humility. Using examples ranging from personal missteps to famous entrepreneurial gambles, this episode is a deep dive into the art of learning from experience, knowing when to listen, and the cost of stubbornness. Plus, Holiday revisits his roots to discuss how Stoic principles can guide you in navigating feedback, balancing ambition with self-awareness, and understanding the fine line between determination and delusion.\n\nHoliday is a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0bestselling author.\u00a0He has written over 10 books, covering both the fundamentals of Stoicism as well as key elements of modern-day marketing and media. His most recent release is\u00a0Right Thing, Right Now.

In this conversation, he spills his secrets on excelling in both arenas.\n\nThis episode is split into two parts: the first 45 minutes covers life and how to be a better person. Brent opens up about the evolution of his marriage, physical health, and inner life.\n\nThe rest of the episode focuses on business. Shane and Beshore discuss private equity, how to hire (and when to fire) CEOs, incentives, why debt isn\u2019t a good thing in an unpredictable world, stewardship versus ownership, and why personality tests are so important for a functional organization.After beginning his career as an entrepreneur, Brent Beshore founded Permanent Equity in 2007 and leads the firm as CEO. He works with investors and operators to evaluate new investment opportunities.\n\n--\n\nNewsletter - The Brain Food newsletter delivers actionable insights and thoughtful ideas every Sunday.

But Chris Davis comes from a family whose grandfather and father all became independently wealthy of each other, and Davis has done the same.\u00a0How does that keep happening? In this conversation, we find out.  Shane and Chris discuss life and investment lessons he learned from his father and grandfather, why writing is more important to clarify one's thinking no matter who's reading it, and the surprising benefit of reading physical newspapers and wearing ties to work. Davis also shares his value-investing philosophy, what he learned from working with and meeting Charlie Munger, and what parents can do to raise kids who aren't entitled. Davis talks about his alcohol drink tracker and why it's important to him, why he never puts himself in situations where envy can grow, and the insights from Warren Buffett's key letter about why investment managers underperform.  Chris Davis is on the board of Berkshire Hathaway and The Coca-Cola Company. Davis is Chairman of Davis Selected Advisers-NY, Inc., an independent investment management firm founded in 1969. Davis joined Davis Selected Advisers-NY, Inc. in 1989 as a financial analyst, and in 1995, he became a portfolio manager of the firm\u2019s flagship funds.\n Watch the episode on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/theknowledgeproject/videos\n Newsletter - I share timeless insights and ideas you can use at work and home.

                    "itunes:summary": "Today, I interview fellow Ottawan and the founder and CEO of Shopify, Tobi L\u00fctke. In case you\u2019re still new to the internet, Shopify is the largest ecommerce platform that allows people to easily set up online storefronts to sell everything from jewelry to surfing lessons.\n Shopify began as a simple two man operation selling snowboards online, but it became clear rather quickly that it had the potential to grow into much more. Now Shopify employs more than 4,000 people and supports more than 600,000 businesses online. It\u2019s a remarkable story, with a remarkable leader at the helm.\n There was so much I wanted to talk to Tobi about that we hop around quite a bit. Here are a few of the topics we discuss:\n  Tobi\u2019s thoughts on how video games helped him prepare to run a company\n How selling snowboards online slowly transitioned to the creation of one of the biggest tech companies in the world\n Why Tobi intentionally headquartered Shopify outside of Silicon Valley and how that fits into his overall growth strategy\n One of the most underrated resources Tobi leans on to mine nuggets of wisdom when trying to get insight or solve a problem\n The hard and valuable lessons Tobi learned as they scaled from a 2 employee company to a 4,000 employee company\n What the \u201cTobi test\u201d is, and how it helps Shopify team members become more adaptable, unified and prepared when things go haywire\n How employees use the \u201ctrust battery\u201d and how it fosters better teamwork, communication, and productivity throughout the company\n The benefits of hiring employees in a \u201csecondary market\u201d as opposed to a \u201cprimary market\u201d and how that contributes to the unique culture at Shopify\n Tobi\u2019s decision-making process and his philosophy on making quick vs analytic decisions\n Tobi\u2019s unusual morning routine that gets him in the right mindset to tackle the day\n His optimistic view of AI and machine learning and how they will impact the way we do things in the future\n  And more\u2026\n Whether you\u2019re building a business of your own, want to create a more dynamic and unified culture at work, or just like hearing entrepreneur war stories, this episode will not disappoint.\n Go Premium: Members get early access, ad-free episodes, hand-edited transcripts, searchable transcripts, member-only episodes, and more.

                    "itunes:summary": "On this episode of the Knowledge Project, I\u2019m joined by the fascinating Dan Ariely. Dan just about does it all. He has delivered 6 TED talks with a combined 20 million views, he\u2019s a multiple New York Times best-selling author, a widely published researcher, and the James B Duke Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University.\n For the better part of three decades, Dan has been immersed in researching why humans do some of the silly, irrational things we do. And yes, as much as we\u2019d all like to be exempt, that includes you too.\n In this captivating interview, we tackle a lot of interesting topics, including:\n  The three types of decisions that control our life and how understanding our biases can help us make smarter decisions\n How our environment plays a big role in our decision making and the small changes we can make to automatically improve our outcomes\n The \u201cbehavioural driven\u201d bathroom scale Dan has been working on to revolutionize weight loss\n Which of our irrational behaviors transfer across cultures and which ones are unique to certain parts of the world (for example, find out which country is the most honest)\n The dishonesty spectrum and why we as humans insist on flirting with the line between \u201chonest\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d\n 3 sneaky mental tricks Dan uses to avoid making ego-driven decisions\n \u201cPluralistic ignorance\u201d and how it dangerously affects our actions and inactions (As a bonus, Dan shares the hilarious way he demonstrates this concept to his students on their first day of class)\n The rule Dan created specifically for people with spinach in their teeth\n The difference between habits, rules, and rituals, and why they are critical to shaping us into who we want to be\n  This was a riveting discussion and one that easily could have gone for hours. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how you\u2019d respond in any of these eye-opening experiments, you have to listen to this interview. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll learn something new about yourself, whether you want to or not. \u00a0\n ***\n Go Premium: Members get early access, ad-free episodes, hand-edited transcripts, searchable transcripts, member-only episodes, and more.

Traces of its first inhabitants have been linked back to 4500 BC. In 1613 BC the most powerful volcanic event in the last 10,000 years took place \u2013 completely destroying all the islands within a 60 km radius. It has been estimated that 90 billion tons of molten rock was injected into the air, the sea swallowed the volcano, and a massive tsunami swept across the Aegean Sea. Along with the obvious devastation of nature, it is believed that the eruption also sealed the deal for the most civilized nation on the island at the time, the Minoans. Thanks to the thick layer of ash cause by the event, the Bronze Age settlement of Akrotiri was so well preserved that we are able to see how prosperous the area had once been with an elaborate drainage systems, multi-storied buildings, incredible wall paintings, furniture and vessels. The site has as much of a significant importance as does Pompeii. The island\u2019s main volcanic rock, its mineral rich soil, and the amazing climate, has produced some incredibly unique wines.

                    "description": "The island of Santorini has not only has breathtaking views but also a fascinating history. Traces of its first inhabitants have been linked back to 4500 BC. In 1613 BC the most powerful volcanic event in the last 10,000 years took place \u2013 completely destroying all the islands within a 60 km radius. It has been estimated that 90 billion tons of molten rock was injected into the air, the sea swallowed the volcano, and a massive tsunami swept across the Aegean Sea. Along with the obvious devastation of nature, it is believed that the eruption also sealed the deal for the most civilized nation on the island at the time, the Minoans. Thanks to the thick layer of ash cause by the event, the Bronze Age settlement of Akrotiri was so well preserved that we are able to see how prosperous the area had once been with an elaborate drainage systems, multi-storied buildings, incredible wall paintings, furniture and vessels. The site has as much of a significant importance as does Pompeii. The island\u2019s main volcanic rock, its mineral rich soil, and the amazing climate, has produced some incredibly unique wines.
