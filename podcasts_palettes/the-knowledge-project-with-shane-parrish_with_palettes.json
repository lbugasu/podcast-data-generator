But Chris Davis comes from a family whose grandfather and father all became independently wealthy of each other, and Davis has done the same.\u00a0How does that keep happening? In this conversation, we find out.<br /> <br /> Shane and Chris discuss life and investment lessons he learned from his father and grandfather, why writing is more important to clarify one's thinking no matter who's reading it, and the surprising benefit of reading physical newspapers and wearing ties to work. Davis also shares his value-investing philosophy, what he learned from working with and meeting Charlie Munger, and what parents can do to raise kids who aren't entitled. Davis talks about his alcohol drink tracker and why it's important to him, why he never puts himself in situations where envy can grow, and the insights from Warren Buffett's key letter about why investment managers underperform.<br /> <br /> Chris Davis is on the board of Berkshire Hathaway and The Coca-Cola Company.

Davis joined Davis Selected Advisers-NY, Inc. in 1989 as a financial analyst, and in 1995, he became a portfolio manager of the firm\u2019s flagship funds.</p> <p><strong>Watch the episode on YouTube</strong>: https://www.youtube.com/c/theknowledgeproject/videos</p> <p><strong>Newsletter</strong> - I share timeless insights and ideas you can use at work and home.

Entrepreneur and educator Luke Burgis goes deep on how understanding mimetic desire can help you better connect the dots between where you are now, and where you want to go. Burgis breaks down the theories behind mimetic desire and the teachings of Ren\u00e9 Girard, why all of our behaviors are imative, why we desire things we don\u2019t need, and why this all leads to missing out on aspects of life that are far more meaningful and valuable.</div> <div>\u00a0</div> <div>Burgis has co-created and led four companies in wellness, consumer products, and technology. He\u2019s currently Entrepreneur-in-Residence and Director of Programs at the Ciocca Center for Principled Entrepreneurship, where he also teaches business at The Catholic University of America.

In 1613 BC the most powerful volcanic event in the last 10,000 years took place \u2013 completely destroying all the islands within a 60 km radius. It has been estimated that 90 billion tons of molten rock was injected into the air, the sea swallowed the volcano, and a massive tsunami swept across the Aegean Sea. Along with the obvious devastation of nature, it is believed that the eruption also sealed the deal for the most civilized nation on the island at the time, the Minoans. Thanks to the thick layer of ash cause by the event, the Bronze Age settlement of Akrotiri was so well preserved that we are able to see how prosperous the area had once been with an elaborate drainage systems, multi-storied buildings, incredible wall paintings, furniture and vessels. The site has as much of a significant importance as does Pompeii. The island\u2019s main volcanic rock, its mineral rich soil, and the amazing climate, has produced some incredibly unique wines. Santorini is known for some of the oldest vineyards in the world. And we know that wine is one of my favourite topics. On today\u2019s podcast I speak with Panayiota Kalogeropoulou about Santorini\u2019s wines. Panayiota is the Director at the Domaine Sigalas vineyard. Paris Sigalas, a mathematician with a goal to make his Santorini vineyard a world heritage site, focuses on grapes that thrive in Santorini (these include the Aidani, Athiri, Plantana \u2013 and the prime Greek grape Assyrtiko).</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p><strong>Go Premium:</strong> Members get early access, ad-free episodes, hand-edited transcripts, searchable transcripts, member-only episodes, and more.
