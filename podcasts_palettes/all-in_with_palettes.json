What's the balance between giving your child room to use his or her agency while showing your love for them? In this week's \"All In\" episode, parenting guru Justin Coulson explains how the Savior's teachings about love, compassion, and mourning with those that mourn apply to the family. Whether we're a parent or not, we can all learn from the Savior's example of how to \"Suffer the little children to come unto me\" (Mark 10:14).</p> <p>\"Sometimes in our angry moments, or in our tired moments, or, let's be honest, in our selfish moments, we might be less loving than we could be towards our children. Sometimes we feel inclined to hurt rather than to help, or...we're neutral or ambivalent, or we shrug our shoulders and say \u2018Whatever'. But He doesn't. The scriptures tell us again and again, His hand, His arm is stretched out still.\"</p> <p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p> <p>\u00a04:47- #GirlDad<br /> \u00a07:00- God\u2019s Example of Parenting<br /> \u00a011:08- Compassion<br /> \u00a016:55- Respect for Agency<br /> \u00a020:59- If Your Child Leaves the Church<br /> \u00a034:06- If Your Child Doesn\u2019t Want to Go to Church<br /> \u00a044:16- If You, As a Parent, Feel It\u2019s Too Late<br /> \u00a049:27- Blurred Lines<br /> \u00a054:51- Encouraging Gospel Discussion in the Home<br /> \u00a01:00:06- What Does It Mean to be \u201cAll In\u201d the Gospel of Jesus Christ?</p> <p>Find the full episode transcript at <a href= \"https://www.ldsliving.com/pages/allin\"><em>ldsliving.com/allin</em></a>.</p> <p>See <a href= \"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",

Please excuse any reference to \u201cMormonism\u201d as a result.\u00a0</em></p> <p>\u201cThis is one of the reasons why God restored the Church in the modern age, because he knew precisely the ways that our social bonds would erode in the 20th and 21st centuries, and the Church is one of the great answers for that. So is it hard sometimes? Yeah, but I think one of the great aspects of the restoration is the we\u2019re put in wards that are geographically defined, we do not choose who we go to church with. And that puts us in company with people of different classes, different races, certainly different genders. People have different life experiences, people that we would never choose to associate with. That's the laboratory of love. That is the school of discipleship.
