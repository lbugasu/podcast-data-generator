First, an opportunity to enroll in a school run by Catholic nuns allowed Astrid to read and write. Second, a chance to be taught by missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about her divine identity as a daughter of God. This powerful combination of secular and spiritual knowledge opened up a whole new world of possibilities for young Astrid.

Today, he is known around the NFL as \u201cLefty,\u201d a nickname given to him after Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid began calling Porter his \u201cleft-hand man.\u201d On this week\u2019s episode, Porter and his wife, Carlie, share the story of\u00a0why Porter has never let having one arm stop him from\u00a0achieving his dreams\u2014and how God paved the\u00a0way for him to do represent something far more\u00a0meaningful than football on the sport's biggest stage.\u00a0</p> <p>\"I believe what he does is super important, not the X's and O's and the winning of games, but professional football doesn't showcase a lot of people who are different. There's not a lot of people with disabilities at the professional sports level because it's the greatest in the world and so to have any sort of perceived weakness isn't going to be on your side.

From playing Joseph Smith in the upcoming film \u201cGreen Flake\u201d to Peter in the concert film of the oratorio \u201cLamb of God,\u201d Elliott captures the humanity of these people and brings them to life. In this week\u2019s episode, we explore what this humanity means to Elliott and how his perception of history has deepened through acting.</p> <p>\u201cCreative ideas in a very real sense are bits of intelligence, bits of spiritual stuff that wasn\u2019t created, it just is there and, as creatives, we have the immense blessing and opportunity to take that and to form it into an identity. And that identity, once formed, almost takes on a life of its own.\u201d</p> <p>Show Notes</p> <p>2:54- \u201cResist Playing to the Icon\u201d<br /> 9:18- Imperfect but Utilized<br /> 12:08- Being Present<br /> 15:07- \u201cThe Spirit of Christ is in the Music\u201d<br /> 21:50- Putting Ourselves in Their Shoes<br /> 24:03- Peter, Our Brother<br /> 30:27- \u201cReaches My Reaching\u201d<br /> 32:24- What Does It Mean To Be All In the Gospel of Jesus Christ?</p> <p>Find the full episode transcript at <a href= \"https://www.ldsliving.com/pages/allin\"><em>ldsliving.com/allin</em></a>.</p> <p>See <a href= \"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",

                    "description": "<p>Marcus Martins never planned to serve a mission, to be sealed in the temple, or to serve as a bishop. These things would require him to receive the priesthood, and there was a restriction in place that precluded him from doing so. But Martins\u2019s life changed forever on June 8, 1978, when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced a revelation extending the priesthood to all worthy male members ages 12 and older. Since that day, Martins has served not only as a missionary, but as a bishop, a temple officiator, a Book of Mormon translator, and a mission president.

The narrative multi-season show has received high praise from viewers and critics alike, earning a 9.8 out of 10 rating on IMDB. But with the praise, it has also attracted skeptics. Some don\u2019t believe evangelical Christians should be working with Latter-day Saints on a show about Jesus or vice versa, and others believe scripture should only be portrayed exactly as it is written without creative liberties. The show\u2019s writer and director, Dallas Jenkins, believes that exploring faith, especially in relation to the Savior, is something that requires trust. On this week\u2019s episode, he shares the triumphs as well as the challenges of depicting the life of the Son of God.</p> <p>\u201cEven though He spoke to crowds, He was always talking personally, and He was always seeking that personal relationship.

You may know many other types of mothers.
