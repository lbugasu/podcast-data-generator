                    "itunes:summary": "Justin Moore is a sponsorship coach and the founder of Creator Wizard, a school and community that teaches you how to find and negotiate your dream brand deals. Along with his wife, April, Justin has been a full-time creator for over 8 years and has personally made over $4,000,000 working with brands. He has also run an influencer agency for over 7 years that helped creators earn an additional $3,000,000. \nNow Justin brings a very unique perspective because not only has he been a creator in the trenches doing sponsorships for years, but by running an agency, he has insider knowledge behind how big brands choose which influencers to partner with and why they pass on others. \nThe conversation you're about to hear is something we recorded for Justin's YouTube channel about a month ago. In 2023, Creator Science earned more than $100,000 in sponsorship alone, but I didn't really have a sponsorship strategy. So in this episode, we changed that completely. Justin helps me see where I'm leaving things on the table. \nFull transcript and show notes\nSponsor Creator Science\nJustin's Website / YouTube / Twitter / Instagram / LinkedIn\n***\nRECOMMENDED NEXT EPISODE\n\u2192\u00a0#179: Justin Moore\n***\nWHEN YOU'RE READY\n\ud83d\udcec Creator Science Newsletter\n\ud83d\ude80 Get CreatorHQ (creator operating system)\n\ud83e\uddea Join The Lab (private membership community)\n\ud83e\uddde\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Get a Personalized Offer\n***\nCONNECT\n\ud83d\udc26 Connect on Twitter\n\ud83d\udcf8 Connect on Instagram\n\ud83d\udcbc Connect on LinkedIn\n\ud83d\udcf9 Subscribe on YouTube\n***\nSPONSORS\n\ud83d\udcbc View all sponsors and offers\n***\nSAY THANKS\n\ud83d\udc9c Leave a review on Apple Podcasts\n\ud83d\udfe2 Leave a rating on Spotify",

This is a solo video where I literally walk through my numbers for the month to show how I\u2019m making money, how I\u2019m spending money, the lessons I\u2019m learning, and the strategy decisions I\u2019m making because of it.\nA lot of members tell me it\u2019s one of their favorite parts of membership.\nTo end the year, I decided to record December\u2019s Retro live with members of The Lab so that they could ask questions as I went along.\nSo this week on the show, I\u2019m sharing with you the audio of that members-only session. You\u2019ll get to listen in on:\n\nHow much money I earned in December (spoiler: it's $40K)\n\nWhere that money comes from\n\nHow I\u2019m thinking about growth on social media\n\n...and a whole lot more.\n\nI think you\u2019re going to enjoy it. And if you do, I would invite you to consider joining The Lab as a member! I\u2019ve capped the total number of spots at 200 so there are less than 40 spots available right now.\nYou can join at https://join.creatorscience.com/\nYou won't regret it!\u00a0\nJoin The Lab\nEnroll in Build A Beloved Membership\n\n***\nRECOMMENDED NEXT EPISODE\n\u2192\u00a0#191: Breaking down my $60,723 product launch\n***\nWHEN YOU'RE READY\n\ud83d\udcec Creator Science Newsletter\n\ud83d\ude80 Get CreatorHQ (creator operating system)\n\ud83e\uddea Join The Lab (private membership community)\n\ud83e\uddde\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Get a Personalized Offer\n***\nCONNECT\n\ud83d\udc26 Connect on Twitter\n\ud83d\udcf8 Connect on Instagram\n\ud83d\udcbc Connect on LinkedIn\n\ud83d\udcf9 Subscribe on YouTube\n***\nSPONSORS\n\ud83d\udcbc View all sponsors and offers\n***\nSAY THANKS\n\ud83d\udc9c Leave a review on Apple Podcasts\n\ud83d\udfe2 Leave a rating on Spotify",

Like when he\u2019s making his podcast Creative Pep Talk. CPT consists of monologues on building a thriving creative practice and conversations with creative powerhouses like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Abbi Jacobson, and Morgan Harper Nichols.\nHis favorite way to illustrate ideas is with analogies and stories on stage. Andy\u2019s style of public speaking is one part TED Talk, one part one-man show \u2014 with a sprinkle of stand-up comedy.\nIn this episode, we talk about creative taste and intuition, watching the tape, playing your hits, creative habits, and why he\u2019s more focused on storytelling than ever before.\nAndy J.
