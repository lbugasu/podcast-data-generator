He started his career in marketing working with ESPN, Google and HubSpot. He hosts Unthinkable, a storytelling podcast about creative people who break from conventional thinking to make what matters most.\nIn this episode of Jay Talking, we talk about how we structured our membership programs, the difference between creators following a Tesla vs. a Toyota model, the psychology of pricing a membership, how I presold access to the Creative Companion Club, and the uncertainties we didn\u2019t let hold us back.\n\ud83d\udc49 Join the Creative Companion Club\nCheck out Jay Acunzo's website\nSubscribe to Unthinkable\nFollow Jay Acunzo on Twitter\nFollow Jay Clouse on Twitter\nFollow Creative Elements on Instagram\nFull transcript and show notes\n***\nSPONSORS\nView all sponsors and offers\n***\nIF YOU LOVE CREATIVE ELEMENTS\nLeave me a voicemail\nSubscribe to weekly episode emails\nLeave a review on Apple Podcasts\nLeave a rating on Spotify\nBuy Me A Coffee\n***\nABOUT JAY CLOUSE\nLearn more about me\nSubscribe to my newsletter, Creative Companion\nConnect with me on Twitter\nConnect with me on Instagram\nJoin #Tweet100\n***\nFOR PODCASTERS\nEnroll in my podcasting workshop\nEnroll in my course on podcasting, Podcast Like The Pros\nLearn more about Podpage\n***\nPODGLOMERATE NETWORK\nThis show is a part of the\u00a0Podglomerate\u00a0network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.
