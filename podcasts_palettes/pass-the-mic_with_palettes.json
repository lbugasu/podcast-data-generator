Are multiethnic churches truly safe spaces for Black women? What happens when Black women #LeaveLoud? Ally had to courageously confront these questions during her time in white evangelicalism. What changed? What did she learn? This is her journey as only she can tell it. This is Ally Henny\u2019s #LeaveLOUD story.\u00a0\n\n*********\n\nIn 2018, the New York Times published an article tiled: A Quiet Exodus: Why Black Worshipers Are Leaving White Evangelical Churches that chronicled the plight of Black Christians who quietly exited their churches after their pastors and fellow believers failed to denounce state-sanctioned violence against Black people, white Christian Nationalism, systemic racism, and everyday bigotry. Since that time, things have gotten worse, not better.\n\nIn recent months, we\u2019ve seen a surge of Black leaders and congregants in predominantly white or multiethnic churches and Christian spaces decide that it\u2019s time for them to go. We bear witness to the hurt, harm, and frustration that our siblings have experienced. Enough is enough. It\u2019s time to #LeaveLOUD\n\nTo #LeaveLOUD is to tell our stories, to name things for what they are, to take back the dignity we\u2019ve lost while being in institutions that don\u2019t value the fullness of the image of God within us, and to go where we are celebrated and not just tolerated.\n\nFor the next several weeks, we will be sharing stories of Black Christians who have made the decision to #LeaveLOUD. We will also be providing thoughtful analysis, words of wisdom, and resources for those who have already left or who are discerning whether they should #LeaveLOUD.
