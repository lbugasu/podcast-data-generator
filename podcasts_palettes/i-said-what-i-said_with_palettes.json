In this episode, we speak to eye witnesses, gunshot victims and bereaved loved ones on their experiences that horrible day, and their lives since then. We also chat with Falz about what the way forward could look like, as well as the importance of memorials and keeping hope alive.

As Idong tells us her study, Jasper explains what\u2019s happening on the fraudsters end, and answers a number of other questions around his choice of occupation. It is a pretty informative episode.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Make sure you rate, share and leave a comment wherever you listen to the podcast telling us how much you enjoyed the episode!

Today, we have partnered with monisense to talk all about financial fraud. Every year, just over 5.2 TRILLION \u00a0dollars are lost to fraud globally. Many individual lives and businesses are ruined and take many years, if ever, to recuperate. This episode hopes to help all our listeners \u201cjazz up\u201d and know what pitfalls to avoid in order to avoid as much as possible, being a victim.</p><p>We have two guests; Idong who had her business accounts wiped out by fraudsters, and Jasper, a \u201cformer\u201d fraudster. As Idong tells us her study, Jasper explains what\u2019s happening on the fraudsters end, and answers a number of other questions around his choice of occupation.
