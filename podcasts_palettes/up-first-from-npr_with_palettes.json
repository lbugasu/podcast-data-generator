As part of the multi-newsroom<a href=\"https://projects.scpr.org/california-reporting-project/\"> California Reporting Project</a>, she has spent years obtaining previously-sealed police internal affairs records, to find out what happens when law enforcement agencies investigate themselves.<br/><br/>In this episode of<em> The Sunday Story</em>, host Ayesha Rascoe speaks with Lewis about the new season of her podcast, <em>On Our Watch</em>, which focuses on correctional officers. Lewis talks about her reporting on New Folsom, one of the most dangerous prisons in California. And she shares the stories of two whistleblowers who worked as correctional officers within the prison and ultimately died while fighting to expose its secrets.<br/><br/>You can listen to all eight episodes of season 2 of <em>On Our Watch</em> at<a href=\"http://kqed.org/podcasts/onourwatch\"> kqed.org/onourwatch</a>.<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href=\"https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices\">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy\">NPR Privacy Policy</a>",
