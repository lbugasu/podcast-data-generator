But when the Taliban captured Kabul, she couldn't see a future for herself anymore. <br/><br/>When Mina landed in the U.S., she learned she only had two years of guaranteed stay. She is one of more than 77,000 Afghans who are currently in the U.S. on a status called humanitarian parole. <br/><br/>In this episode of <em>The Sunday Story</em>, journalist Lauren DeLaunay Miller digs into the history of humanitarian parole.
