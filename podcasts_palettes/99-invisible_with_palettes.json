In 6-on-6 basketball, the three forwards only play offense. And the three guards only play defense. No one is allowed to leave their assigned half of the court. 6-on-6 still uses the full length of a basketball court, but in a different way than 5-on-5. In 6-player, three forwards from one team and three guards from the opposing team play at one end of the court. Meanwhile their teammates wait at the half court line.

Snake venom can have up to 200 different toxins inside it and each toxin has a different horrible effect to your body. Some attack your muscles, while others attack your nerves.

Part of the reason people are dying is because they're not getting antivenom - the medicine required to fight these horrible toxins - fast enough.

This is where my friend, neighbor and brains behind this operation, Elizabeth Joh, comes in. She is a professor at the UC\u00a0 Davis school of law and she teaches Con Law. And since June of 2017, she has been kind enough to hang out with me and teach me lessons about the US Constitution, that I then record and release as the podcast <em>What Trump Can Teach us About Con Law</em>. We call it <em>Trump Con Law</em> for short.</p>\n<p>After a long hiatus, we\u2019re back with monthly episodes, so I wanted to reintroduce it to the 99pi audience because you may not know about it and because people often comment that the nature of the calm historically grounded, educational discussion is a soothing salve amidst the chaotic and unnerving political news of the day.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re presenting two classic episodes on Impeachment and Prosecuting a President.</p>\n<p>Subscribe to What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/what-trump-can-teach-us-about-con-law/id1242537529\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href=\"https://radiopublic.com/TrumpConLaw\" target=\"_blank\">RadioPublic</a></p>\n<p><p>Subscribe to SiriusXM Podcasts+ on Apple Podcasts to listen to ad-free new episodes and get exclusive access to bonus content.</p></p>",
