Hendricks set up the Center for Information and Bubble Studies at the University of Copenhagen to study how individual and media behavior online has created a reality where virality, social spread, and repetition is all that\u2019s required for people to believe something is true.</p> <p>While \u201cfacts\u201d haven\u2019t gone totally by the wayside, the way we cherry pick facts to make alternate realities has created a political system (and a culture) where we can\u2019t have rational arguments because we can\u2019t even agree on a baseline of truth.</p> <p>Radio Motherboard spoke to Hendricks about this week\u2019s debate and about his new book, <b>Infostorms</b>, which explores how our likes, upvotes, retweets, coupled with social media algorithms and brash politicians with a disregard for the truth are redefining rational society.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

This week, we tackle the iPhone 6S release, talk about whether basic income will ever become a reality, and touch a bit on why reporting on the Hacking Team has been so much fun.
