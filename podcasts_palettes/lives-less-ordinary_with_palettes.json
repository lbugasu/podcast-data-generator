It would take her 15 years to face it head on, and in doing so she redefined what it meant to be a climber.</p><p>Beth's book A Light Through the Cracks: A Climber's Story is out now.</p><p>Clips are from NPR and the Associated Press.</p><p>Presenter: Emily Webb\nProducer: Louise Morris</p><p>Get in touch: liveslessordinary@bbc.co.uk or WhatsApp: 0044 330 678 2784</p>"
