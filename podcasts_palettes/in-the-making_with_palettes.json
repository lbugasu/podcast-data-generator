Naturally, such upbringing played an integral part in forming Lopez\u2019s keen sense of style, art, and design, which can be realized in his works today. Looking for freedom and a better life, Lopez moved to the United States at fifteen, where he continued working on his skill for the next 10 years privately. Magdiel decided to reveal his work in a series called \u201cA Poster A Day\u201d \u2014 releasing one piece of artwork on his Instagram everyday for 365 days. Each day garnered more attention from a global audience and press coverage by the New York Times, Cosmopolitan, Entrepreneur, and Awwwards.

Data visualization designers work to sort through the numbers using both science and creativity to find the stories they have to tell, and help us understand the world a little better. But what goes into designing an effective data visualization, and how do you balance the art and the science of it? In this episode of Wireframe, host Khoi Vinh, and producers Dominic Girard and Pippa Johnstone, learn how designers are building charts, games, and more to take the numb out of numbers.</p><p>If you\u2019ve been fighting over housework during lock down, you\u2019re not alone. Designer <a href=\"https://www.amycesal.com\">Amy Cesal</a> and her husband, Zander Furnas used data visualization to clean up the messy business of their own household chores, and made the invisible, visible, along the way.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://shirleywu.studio\">Shirley Wu</a>, worried that people weren\u2019t taking the pandemic seriously enough. Her data visualization game, <a href=\"https://peopleofthepandemicgame.com\">People of the Pandemic</a>, helps us understand the consequences of defying stay at home orders.\u00a0</p><p>And <a href=\"http://albertocairo.com\">Alberto Cairo</a> outlines the responsibilities data visualization designers must balance when designing with data. He\u2019s the author of How Charts Lie, and the Knight Chair in Visual Journalism at the School of Communication of the University of Miami.</p><p>The New York Times visualization we referenced is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/21/insider/covid-500k-front-page.html\">here</a>. The Washington Post\u2019s most read article is a data visualization that you can <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/\">see here</a>.
