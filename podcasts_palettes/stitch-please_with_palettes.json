            "contentSnippet": "This week, Lisa speaks with talented Swiss-Haitian-Finnish artist Sasha Huber to explore the intersections of art, activism, and healing. Sasha shares her journey from her family's legacy of textile arts to her cutting-edge activist-based art practice.\nAs Sasha unfolds her story of \"reparative intervention,\" using her pneumatic staple gun to highlight social and historical injustices, we'll examine how her art taps into the deep-rooted pain of colonialism and the ways in which her work strives to stitch together a narrative of resistance and preservation. From discussing the decolonization of museums to the history of laws governing black attire during slavery in the United States, this conversation promises to be as thought-provoking as it is enlightening.\nGather your threads of curiosity and join us as we sew together the pieces of Sasha Huber's remarkable journey, and discover how her art becomes a protective and healing force against the scars of history. Let's \"get our stitch together\" by learning how to make meaning out of the materials handed down to us. \n=======\nSasha Huber \nSasha Huber (b. 1975) is a Helsinki-based internationally recognized visual artist-researcher of Swiss-Haitian heritage. Huber's work is concerned with the politics of memory, care and belonging in relation to colonial residues left in the environment. Connecting history and the present, she uses and responds to archival material within a layered creative practice that encompasses performance-based reparative interventions, video, photography, and collaborations. Huber also usurps the staple gun, aware of its symbolic significance as a weapon, while offering the potential to renegotiate unequal power dynamics and the possibility of repair, symbolically stitching wounds together (pain-things). Known for her artistic research contribution to the \u201cDemounting Louis Agassiz\u201d campaign, she is aiming at reassessing the glaciologist\u2019s contentious racist heritage.  \nSasha's Website \n@sashahuber on Instagram \n=======\nReady to tap in to the visuals of Stitch Please?

Grace shares her journey into sewing, which began as a way to keep her mind active after moving to the United States (US) with her one-year-old child. Growing up in Nigeria, Grace had been exposed to her mother's sewing, but it wasn't until later that she truly delved into the craft.\u00a0\nGrace's sewing journey began with an old treadle machine but when she moved to the US, she acquired an electric sewing machine, making her sewing experience more accessible. Her early projects were primarily for herself and her son, driven by a desire to connect with her Nigerian heritage.\u00a0\nAs Grace's sewing skills grew, so did her interest in different types of fabrics. She now offers a wide range of fabrics on her website, including Knit Ankara, Silk Adire, and Kampala. Grace provides insights into the cultural significance and unique characteristics of each fabric type, shedding light on their origins and traditional uses.\u00a0\nGrace's approach to designing garments is influenced by her desire to celebrate the diversity of African fashion. She emphasizes the importance of allowing the fabric to speak for itself and encourages people to experiment with different styles and fabric combinations. Grace actively builds a sense of community among her customers through sew-alongs and challenges. These events provide opportunities for individuals to explore their creativity and gain confidence in working with African fabrics.\u00a0\nThe podcast episode concludes with Grace expressing her aspiration to flood the streets with African prints and her dedication to empowering others to embrace and incorporate these fabrics into their own creations.

A move to the US and motherhood rekindled her love for sewing, inspiring her to blend her Nigerian heritage with her creative passion for sewing. Grace's designs breathe life into African fabrics, infusing them with modern flair.

You can mix and match these contrasting colors to create something that is so beautiful and uniquely you.\" - Aaronica B. Cole, Stitch Please, Episode #206\n\"People think of clothing as something superficial... They don't dig deeper and understand the psychology behind fashion and behind the clothing choices that we make. Imagine walking around and only feeling good enough to wear a sack... as opposed to being able to see your body as being beautiful enough to actually adorn it.\" - Aaronica B. Cole, Stitch Please, Episode #206\n\"I think what I've been thinking a lot about is a lot of the knowledge systems that have been developed for sewing in particular and for fashion by extension, were never made with black bodies in mind, period done. And it is, I think a flaw, a type of little flaw in the industry that started as something small in the 1940s but has never changed.\" - Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #206\n\"And so it's become in my mind malignant.

The discussion stresses the importance of embracing creative expression in an environment that embraces all participants as teachers and supportive community members. This welcoming community strongly encourages the idea of making patterns your own. \n\nThe Garment Girlies have been brought together to help create a space with different channels and programs with the primary goal being to amplify and celebrate black voices in the sewing community while being an inclusive space that welcomes and supports all who participate! They advise taking breaks from social media when needed to avoid comparing your creations to others and encourage beginners to start where they are, reminding listeners that the community will provide a warm welcome and support you on your journey!\n\nThis episode highlights the power of self-expression and the strength of community that the Black Sewing Network provides."

You\u2019re using different fabrics and even if you use some of the same fabrics, it would be different outcomes. If you use some of the same shapes, it will look a bit different\u201d \u2013 <strong>Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #204</strong></li><li>\u201cJust do it! Just try it! Even if you are scared, like, I was scared to death to start bags, but I just did it. The first one, very questionable, but I did it. And the second part to that, is \u201cTake your time!\u201d. I am doing a bag right now and it\u2019s taking me forever. I think Nikki asked about it on one of my Tiktoks. It\u2019s fifty million pieces, but I\u2019m not a quitter, so I\u2019m gonna finish that bag. But take your time because you wanna make sure that you grasp whatever concept it is that\u2019s telling you to do the bag or the process, and then you wanna make sure it sticks and then that will help you in the end, as far as other bag making.\u201d \u2013 <strong>Lanae, Stitch Please, Episode #204</strong></li><li>\u201cGive yourself grace! You\u2019re not gonna be out the gate perfect at anything, you\u2019re gonna have that first test run. So, give yourself grace and be patient.\u201d \u2013 <strong>Nikki, Stitch Please, Episode #204</strong></li><li>\u201cEnjoy the journey!

You\u2019re using different fabrics and even if you use some of the same fabrics, it would be different outcomes. If you use some of the same shapes, it will look a bit different\u201d \u2013 Lisa Woolfork, Stitch Please, Episode #204\n\u201cJust do it! Just try it! Even if you are scared, like, I was scared to death to start bags, but I just did it. The first one, very questionable, but I did it. And the second part to that, is \u201cTake your time!\u201d. I am doing a bag right now and it\u2019s taking me forever. I think Nikki asked about it on one of my Tiktoks. It\u2019s fifty million pieces, but I\u2019m not a quitter, so I\u2019m gonna finish that bag. But take your time because you wanna make sure that you grasp whatever concept it is that\u2019s telling you to do the bag or the process, and then you wanna make sure it sticks and then that will help you in the end, as far as other bag making.\u201d \u2013 Lanae, Stitch Please, Episode #204\n\u201cGive yourself grace! You\u2019re not gonna be out the gate perfect at anything, you\u2019re gonna have that first test run. So, give yourself grace and be patient.\u201d \u2013 Nikki, Stitch Please, Episode #204\n\u201cEnjoy the journey!

On this week's episode of Stitch Please, we're joined by the incredibly talented Sahara Clemons. Fresh off presenting her latest collection at New York Fashion Week, Sahara --a recent graduate of RISD -- gives us an intimate look behind the seams of her creative process.\n\nThrough vivid storytelling, Sahara walks us through how she transformed her personal experiences with eczema into a stunning five-piece collection entitled \"Skin Deep.\" We learn about her inspirations, from oceanic textures to 1940s swimwear, and how she brought her vision to life through illustrations, textile manipulations, and custom fabric dyeing.\n\nThe passion Sahara has for using fashion as a means of self-exploration and community building is truly inspiring. She shares valuable insights on embracing imperfection, finding beauty in the little things, and having the courage to bring your imaginary projects to reality.\n\nWhether you're an aspiring designer or just looking to reconnect with your own creativity, you'll find immense inspiration in Sahara's words. So get ready to immerse yourself in a world of breathtaking artistry and deep personal meaning. Let Sahara's wisdom wash over you like the tranquil tide and awaken your inner artist.

Despite breaking her ankle in a backyard mishap, Lisa is eager to create a stylish fall wardrobe that will work with her medical boot and accommodate limited mobility.\n\nOn her pattern wishlist are comfortable knits like Simplicity 8982, a trendy KnowMe 2046 combo dress/tunic/pant set, and the elegant Vogue 1940 dramatic sleeves. She'll also try extending a Vogue button-front shirtdress into a tunic to wear with leggings and boots.\n\nLisa dishes on her trick for customizing tricky commercial patterns designed for non-curvy figures, her aversion to most dress pockets, and why she may forego zippers in super stretchy knits. She'll also chat about beautiful wide leg pants from Mimi G's new Simplicity pattern that could accommodate her boot.\n\nJoin the fun fabric chatter and wardrobe planning for fall - a great transitional sewing season! Lisa shares why she loves sewing with quilting cottons, stable wovens, linen blends, and more. Tune in for all the pattern wishlist details, sewing motivation, and wardrobe visions that will help you get your stitch together."

Many institutions and museums have acquired Butler\u2019s work including the Art Institute of Chicago for a solo exhibition, The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, and The Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.\nInsights from this episode:\n\nWhy it\u2019s important to uplift and encourage each other, starting with the children in our lives\nHow Bisa uses her art to affirm the dignity of historical figures\nThe process of researching historical figures and time periods to accurately portray them through art\nHow different colors play into the meaning expressed in her art\nHow Bisa infuses her quilts with the music she\u2019s listening to as she creates\nWhat happens when you stop starting with \u2018white\u2019 as a default\nInsights into the difference between studying art education (teaching people how to make art) vs. learning how to make art yourself\n\nQuotes from the show:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always seeking for truth and to find those essential truth elements about Black people.\u201d \u2013 Bisa Butler, Stitch Please, Episode #200\n\u201cI have had people ask me, people who don\u2019t necessarily look like us so they don\u2019t have a full understanding, \u2018I notice that you make all of your subjects look...",

                "summary": "In this episode of the Stitch Please podcast we are celebrating our 200th episode with Bisa Butler, a talented textile artist schooling us in the beautiful intricacies of Black possibility. Bisa\u2019s work showcases historical images of Black life from the early 20th century in a multisensory format, incorporating fabrics, the feeling of the music that she\u2019s listening to as she creates, and playlists that accompany her art to make that experience accessible to the viewer. Bisa shares the inspiration, techniques, and meaning behind some of Lisa\u2019s favorite pieces, along with what she hopes to communicate through her art and the material of the fabric itself. They discuss why the missing piece in Ken\u2019s wardrobe was a pair of tweed pants, their experiences as children seeing moments captured in black and white photography and film, and what it meant as a Black artist to study at Howard University, the alma mater of legendary geniuses like Zora Neale Hurston and Toni Morrison.\n\nPATREON SUPPORTERS get video access to this beautiful and powerful episode."

Lisa explains her motivation for attending QuiltCon for the first time and shares her excitement over the increased representation of Black women and Black-owned businesses at the event. Rashida discusses debuting her new fabric line and the emotional experience of seeing Black women wearing and excited about her fabrics. The hosts share their \"fangirl\" moments meeting renowned Black quilters like Latifah Saafir in person. \n\nThey also discuss Lisa's intentionality about who she chooses to collaborate with for Black Women Stitch projects, and her realization that suffering through unpaid work would not dismantle capitalism or white supremacy - but taking resources to support Black women's crafts could. The hosts and Rashida share advice on self-care and \"getting your stitch together\" during difficult times. The episode celebrates community, ancestral crafts, collaboration, and joyful spaces for Black women quilters.\n"

                "summary": "In this special \"Sew Black at Quiltcon\" episode of the \"Black Women Stitch\" podcast, host Lisa Woolfork invites us into the textured narratives of Black heritage with her guests Sarah Bond and e bond. Sarah shares her poignant journey of collaboration; connecting with living family members like e bond, and also honoring the powerful legacies of ancestral women, such as Lavinia, her great-great-grandmother born into slavery in 1858, and Jane, born in 1828. Through the art of quilting, both navigate visual and auditory dialogues, reflecting on the essence of Black aliveness in a world that often places demands on Black identity. Highlighted in the episode is the Lavinia Unbound quilt, as well as e bond's \"Glyphs\" collection, an ode to sci-fi genius, Octavia Butler. The episode's pinnacle is the discussion of an 1870s basket quilt, capturing the spirit and audacity of Black women. A heartfelt acknowledgment to the sponsors and listeners underscores the importance of these narratives. Support their continuing journey on Patreon."

Creating safe, nourishing spaces for Black femmes and folks impacted by misogynoir through digital media and live events is her style of activism. She is one half of The Tea with Queen and J. podcast and centers dismantling white supremacist patriarchal capitalism, because why the fuck not! Always encouraging healthy community building, her podcast\u2019s annual Black podcast meetup, #PodinLiveNYC, has grown into the largest Black podcaster meetup in the world! Ms.Vixen, her online magazine, has been running 7 years strong, and with the addition of live events and workshops through the Ms.Vixen IRL series, plus Ms. Vixen The Podcast, she continues to deliver incisive, witty, lit womanist perspectives on pop culture, media, and politics. Queen\u2019s work has also been featured at Afropunk.com, AMny, and you can catch her as a panelist on the youtube series, The Grapevine. Always someone with something to say, her goal is media domination, to always have huge hair, and to always stay fly.\nJ.\nJ. is a cultural critic, podcast producer, and a womanist race nerd from the Bronx focused on dismantling white supremacist patriarchal capitalism while laughing, drinking tea, and indulging in various forms of Black joy. For over five years she's created audio content centering Black women and Black femme-identifying individuals, exploring America's caste system, allowing herself to learn and be challenged publicly, and sharing her journey through mental health. As a podcast geek with a commitment to increasing visibility and access for people of color, she co-founded #PodinLiveNYC, the largest annual Black podcast meetup in the world. In addition to freedom and liberation, Janicia loves cosplay, believes there's a special place in her heart (and hell) for body paint, and lovingly asks that you do not call her a \"lady\".\nLisa Woolfork\nLisa Woolfork is an associate professor of English specializing in African American literature and culture. Her teaching and research explore Black women writers, Black identity, trauma theory, and American slavery. She is the founder of Black Women Stitch, the sewing group where Black lives matter. She is also the host/producer of Stitch Please, a weekly audio podcast that centers on Black women, girls, and femmes in sewing. In the summer of 2017, she actively resisted the white supremacist marches in her community, Charlottesville, Virginia. The city became a symbol of lethal resurging white supremacist violence. She remains active in a variety of university and community initiatives, including the Community Engaged Scholars program. She believes in the power of creative liberation.\nInsights from this episode:\n\nMaking spaces like music festivals feel more welcoming to queer folks\nCreating intergenerational events that appeal to everyone and avoid ageism\nThe effect of marginalized people thinking from a scarcity mindset\nWho gets their work published and why\nWhy it\u2019s important to remember that there is always room for your voice and your story\nThe role of capitalism in holding us back from pursuing...",

                "summary": "In this very special episode of the Stitch Please podcast, Lisa chats with Queen and J. from the Tea with Queen and J. podcast about their first time attending the Essence festival in New Orleans, which is not only the largest Black-organized festival but the largest festival of any kind in the United States. They talk about its reputation for being an \u2018Auntie Con\u2019 and how events can be more intergenerational and welcoming to members of the queer community, musical performances by Janelle Monae, Megan Thee Stallion, and Jill Scott, and surprising moments of community care. Queen and J. discuss their own role in building Black community through events like #PodinLiveNYC and organizing a Juneteenth celebration geared towards a younger demographic, sweet dinner, and sea oysters, and they have an important conversation about why there is always room for more voices and more stories."

Julian Collins, Carmen Green, and Terrance Williams have done powerful work in the sewing community to change culture, lives, make demands, and step forward to create a space that is more loving, more inclusive, and more in line with what it means to be a free people. Their community shares ideas, resources, and an appreciation for Beyonce, and today they share how anyone can create a Beyonce-worthy costume whether you\u2019ve been sewing Beyonce designs since 2010 like Carmen, will be center stage as a VIP like Terrance, attending your very first concert like Julian, or singing along at home on the livestream with your friends. This is the summer of fun and acceptance, your chance to celebrate you and your uniqueness and be proud of who you are."

Black Magic Leopard is an amazing fabric that looks like leopard print from a distance, but when you get close up, it is actually images of Black folks in natural hairstyles. It was designed by two Black women: Queenora who saw an optical illusion, and Janine who made that optical illusion into reality. They discuss the creative process, collaboration with other artists, and seeing a project through from the initial idea to the response from the community it was made for."

In this electrifying conversation, Lisa talks with Janine Lecour, a remarkable surface pattern designer. Bursting with creativity, Janine's journey as an artist takes center stage. Janine  shares her captivating story. From her early days as an artsy kid to her pursuit of design at the renowned Savannah College of Art and Design, her passion for the creative arts has always been her driving force. With boundless enthusiasm, she ventured into the world of design, eager to explore the endless possibilities that awaited her. Throughout her artistic process, Janine\u2019s unwavering determination leads her to unexpected ventures, such as digitizing patterns for an Italian company and eventually delving into the design of scarves. Though lacking extensive experience, Janine fearlessly experiments, learning and growing through trial and error, and discovering the liberating nature of digital design.\n"

                "summary": "In this engaging interview between Lisa and Martha for the Stitch Please podcast, they dive into Martha's sewing journey and how it all began. Martha shares her frustration with the limited options and high prices of plus-size clothing, which ultimately led her to purchase a sewing machine and embark on a path of creating her own outfits. The conversation delves into the biases and challenges faced by plus-size individuals in the fashion industry, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and representation within the sewing community.\n\nAs Martha is an avid traveler, they explore how she incorporates her handmade garments into her vacation wardrobe. Martha discusses her approach to planning outfits based on themes and occasions, and the intention behind her fabric choices. She values fabrics that are stretchy, easy to pack, and quick to dry. Lisa acknowledges Martha's ability to confidently wear her creations, becoming a possibility model for others.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Martha shares meaningful moments when fellow sewists have admired her me-made outfits and expressed a desire to create their own. The discussion highlights the joy, empowerment, and self-expression that come from wearing clothes that make you feel good. The interview concludes with Martha reflecting on a recent trip where she packed a whole cube of me-made clothes that didn't even get opened, showcasing her extensive collection of handmade garments.\n\nThis captivating interview invites listeners to delve into Martha's sewing journey, her passion for travel, and the positive impact of self-made clothing on confidence and personal style.\n\n"

Her passion for sewing began when she wanted to alter her clothes after losing weight and not having the budget to buy new ones. In this episode, Tasha talks about the intersection of dance and sewing in her life, the influence of her trip to Panama and her Panamanian heritage on her creativity, and the intricate details of her gorgeous New York Frocktail dress. Throughout her journey, Tasha discovered her creative process and how sewing gives her the clarity she needs to achieve her goals. Her story is a testament to the transformative power of pursuing one's passions and a reminder that with hard work and dedication, anything is possible."

                "summary": "In this episode of the Stitch Please podcast, host Lisa Woolfork talks to Cecily Habimana, co-owner of Sew Creative Lounge, about the upcoming Sew Much Soul Quilting Conference. The conference, which will take place from April 14 to 17, 2023 will feature highly-skilled and professional sewing and quilting educators who will be teaching for free. Cecily explains that the conference was started in 2021 as a way to bring together the sewing and quilting communities in a virtual space during the pandemic. The conference is now in its fourth edition and has become a much-anticipated event for the community. \nThe episode also features some of the instructors who will be teaching at the conference, including Lisa Shepard Stewart,  Carol Gary Staples and Janet Green. Lisa will be teaching a class on creating a magic nine patch clutch, while Carol will be teaching a class on making scrappy Black girl magic. Janet Green explains how students in her class with learn that improvisation is a synonym for \"play\"  and that perfectionism is a fallacy. Cecily also talks about the energy and attention to detail that goes into organizing a conference like So Much Soul, especially when it is held virtually.\n\nThroughout the episode, Lisa and Cecily discuss their experiences at other quilting conferences, including QuiltCon, which they both attended recently in Atlanta, Georgia. They also talk about the importance of bringing together Black communities within the sewing and quilting world, and the benefits of learning from different perspectives and techniques. Overall, the episode is a great preview of what attendees can expect at the Sew Much Soul Quilting Conference, and a celebration of our diversity and creativity.\n"

                "summary": "In this episode of Stitch Please, Stacey Watson talks about how she has made history very black by teaching it differently to her students. She is redefining what it means to teach history both in the classroom and in the gallery. Stacey wants you not only to understand the how but the why, the who, and the where to not only memorize history but be part of it. Stacey talks us through the detective method that she applies with her students, her work, and exhibitions at The National Quilt Museum. Her exhibition \u201cSay Your Piece- Black Women: Mothers, Martyrs, and Misunderstood\" is the first installation of the Say Your Piece three-part series. It has been described as \u201ca visual journey that includes a combination of symbolism and inspiration attached to the African diaspora, heightening our sense of cultural awareness. It is a unique experience as it provides the artists an opportunity to display what speaks to them, to you, to us.\u201d The exhibit closes on February 21st."

Carmen tells us how she had navigated the difficulties of growing and building a community on TikTok, the effort and love that she puts into her Network for it to be a space to which people want to return again and again, and really how to thrive into a social media algorithm that isn't really designed for Black people."

Shasta talks about her journey in historical costuming and how she was unaware that cosplay has a negative connotation. While she has lots of inspiration, her interest in art museums has been instrumental in her work. Shasta also talks about finding her community in costuming and the challenges she has experienced while making garments. "

As she got older, she started learning the patterns and taught herself to read them and make staff on her own. Marcia Spencer takes us through her fashion transitions from making children's clothing to bags and ultimately to high street fashion and all the driving factors that led her there. She also highlights her inspiration for creating a piece and its versatility. "

Learn more about this delightfully Black festive holiday from its founder and principal organizer Jasmine LeFleur and Kia Sangria, a 2022 ambassador.  Both are visionary joy practitioners within the Black Fae community, a platform and annual event that increases the positive visibility of Black people in mainstream fantasy.

She\u2019s fierce, she\u2019s smart, and today Aja joins the Stitch Please podcast to share her book, Consumed: The Need For Collective Change: Colonialism, Climate Change and Consumerism, and the inspiration behind her words surrounding unethical and unsustainable consumerism in the fashion industry.  Aja shares her perspective on how consumerism and capitalism feed on our insecurities. This opened up the conversation as we talked about the exploitative nature of the fashion industry, why transparency doesn\u2019t equal sustainability, and the interlocking systems of oppression that coincide with capitalism. Aja also shares how consumers can use their collective power for positive change and why we need to start investigating our shopping habits so we can change how we participate in the system.This episode is an insightful lesson on the perils of fast fashion, the reasons why,as a society, we tie our happiness to consumerism, and how to make more sustainable and ethical choices with our clothes. So tune in and be inspired by this impactful episode. [Photo Credit for Aja's podcast cover photos: Stephen Cunningsworth]"

She joins the show to share her story of how she was born into sewing. Alexis also shares her experience making the leap to fully owning her own business, where the name of her academy came from, and the challenges she faces as a business owner. For embroiderers who are wanting to make the leap from single needle machines, Alexis explains her process of making the leap from a single needle to multi-needle machines. This is a fun episode where Alexis takes us behind the scenes of her business and process, even sharing details of the challenging materials she had to embroider as well as how she made the shift from embroidery to teaching."

She creates community through her teachings online and in-person, and is a hands-on, fully-involved community member. She joins the Stitch Please podcast to share how she got her start in the art world as a fiber and needle artist. Kianga also shares her story of creating her first doll for her daughter and the process of creation that happened behind the scenes. Kianga also talks about the opportunities she\u2019s received to travel around the world, furthering her craft in Ghana and South Africa. This opened up our conversation as we discussed Kianga\u2019s curiosity and hunger not just for living her everyday life as a Black woman, but also to learned and rediscover her ancestry and legacy through the mediums of art and literature. This episode is a true exploration of art, culture, and legacy. So tune in, get curious, and get inspired by this truly powerful conversation."

She\u2019s written many books, including Crafted Lives: Stories and Studies of African American Quilters. Pat joins the Stitch Please podcast to share why it's important to understand the broad diversity of Black people through quilting and what it means to think about quilts as artifacts to be studied within a cultural context. This opened up our conversation as we talked about the nine patch quilt block and how she used this common quilting pattern to communicate the breadth of the African-American experience through the quilter. Pat shares her views on urban legends, why they appeal to us, and what it means to think of something as a legend versus a fabrication. Pat also explains why it\u2019s important to cherish and recognize the full humanity of Black folks and why that's something that often gets overlooked. This episode is an enlightening lesson on legends, reality, and anthropological literary perspectives of black quilters. So tune in, get curious, and get inspired by this incredible conversation. "

She shapes metal pieces, building permanent, touchable shadows that look like they\u2019ve been forecasted from the past to be and resonate in our present. Her most recent installation, Rich Soil, is placed directly in an organic garden environment. Her art is powerful, beautiful, and incredibly resonant. Even though she is not a sewer or quilter, we\u2019re incredibly lucky to have her on the Stitch Please podcast to share her story of being a self-taught artist, providing opportunities for reflection through her art, and how the medium of art can connect us to our ancestors. Tune in to this episode and listen as Kristine shares her thoughts on art as a powerful tool that honors our history, exploring the parameters around God, the importance of art and critical thinking, and crafting through the lens of Black Women\u2019s Liberation and Black feminism."

Dr. Renita Weems for a vibrant and textured conversation exploring and celebrating the common threads of Black women\u2019s experience, weaving seamlessly the complexities of identity and passion through literature, religion, and spirituality, while honoring self-expression and creativity, especially through the domestic arts. \n\nRev. Dr. Weems reflects on her colorful life experiences from a brief and unhappy career in Economics, to Black feminist collectives, discovering writing, attending seminary, and her remarkable life beyond. Rev. Dr. Weems\u2019 relays her  evolving relationship with sewing-  how, for example,  sewing her own clothing brought the theory of body positivity, into her embodied experience.  And, while speaking very personally, Rev. Dr. Weems shares a direct message to listeners encouraging self-regard without judgment or stigma, protecting and honoring \u201cthe work that the soul must have,\u201d tending to one\u2019s own self- fashioning and on-going formation.\n"

The strength of Martha's connections to her Garifuna roots is boundless and palpable in this episode as she explores the rich traditions of her people and the focus it brings to her Christmas celebration. \n\nThrough spoken word, dance, song, rhythm, music, costumery, color, and a bit of trickery, discover how Martha and her family carry traditional celebrations forward well before Christmas so that, to use Martha's words, \"when Christmas comes the energy is bubbling.\" "

She is the fashioner of the most ingenious villanelles and vests alike \u2014 in lavender velvet no less! And she \u201cwalks with grace along beauty\u2019s seam.\u201d\n\nTogether, Rita and Lisa talk salvaging materials, experimenting with pattern, and achieving the perfect tension of the stitch. What does it take to hold that balance? How does sewing work as a metaphor for poetry, and vice versa? \n\nSewn into the dialogue, too, is the still untold story of craft in Black women\u2019s histories. In Rita's book, that story reverberates in every visible and invisible seam. Are you listening? \n"

                "summary": " Little did Sarah Bond know in 1979, when she started making her first quilt, that she was sitting on top of a gold mine of strikingly rare quilts. My guest Sarah Bond does not hide the explosion of emotions she had when she discovered the treasure chest of quilts in the basement of her house. It was a magic moment, and her desire to trace the history and story of those quilts connected the invisible threads of time and the artistic revelation that happened in her family during the dark times of slavery. The \u201cThreads Across Time\u201d episode with Sarah Bond travels through time to more than a century ago and brings back a legacy of Quilt art by her enslaved ancestors. The fact that Sarah Bond still preserves those quilts portrays that they were not created just for utilitarian purposes. They were a product of love and expression. As she says, \u201cThose quilts are the physical manifestation of their struggle and victory\"."

The author of Fashion Africa and Founding Director of Africa Fashion Guide, Jacqueline speaks with Lisa about her desire to have creative autonomy, to share stories of contemporary African designers, and to remake the textile supply chain to better serve people and the planet. After working in the fashion industry, she earned a Master\u2019s focused on sustainability in textiles and decided to put her education into practice. Today, she advocates for ethical fashion and runs the company Wax and Wraps, which curates subscription boxes of fabrics produced by African designers and entrepreneurs.\n\n"

They discuss processing trauma, using crafting as a means of spiritual healing, and navigating the dangerous roads of Pinterest.\nLydia seamlessly blends her crafting, bible verses, and her social and political activism to use her platform to highlight and promote the value and beauty of black people, especially those who are treated as disposable in their community by white friends and acquaintances. You can follow her work on Instagram and YouTube or purchase her creations from her Etsy shop.\n\nContent Warning: Explicit discussion of Charlottesville, VA white supremacist terror attacks."

Jasika shares her insights on how the Hollywood industry essentially runs as a corporation, and how bureaucracy can destroy the creative process. In order to use her creative muscles Jasika sews clothes and shares them on social media. Sewing has brought balance into her life, allowing her to be creative, while still maintaining her career.  Jasika practices creative liberation by giving herself permission to explore all the different aspects of herself. Her experience has taught her she cannot look to institutions for freedom as they are designed to protect themselves. Creative liberation is important because it asks us to identify what we value, outside of things capitalism tells us to value. It asks us to be our whole selves, and show up for our community without limitations. It is a practice that needs to be exercised. Jasika Nicole has been showing up as her whole self and helping others find the strength to do so as well.\n"

Inspired by Alexis Pauline Gumbs teaching that \"Freedom isn't a secret. It is a practice,\" the Stitch Please podcast celebrates the many ways that Black women, girls, and femmes  continually practice creative ways to get, be, and stay free. \nWe begin the month strong. This episode is all about Intentional Sewing and Intentional Living. Our special guest truly embodies this topic. If you know Kamali Obiagu from Instagram, you know that she radiates confidence in photos where she wears her impeccably stitched creations. Lisa talks with her about what it took to get to that place - discovering a sewing community (and PDF patterns!) and learning to love the body she\u2019s in today. They\u2019ll also dive into why Kamali gave herself a new name when she turned 30 and the importance of self-care. Listen in!\n\n\n"

And today's context is SUCH. GREAT. NEWS! We are celebrating Alissa Bertrand of JaBellaFleur, who was on the podcast in February 2020. Alissa's eclectic mix of colorful patterns and prints are a fashion forward way to sustainability. Inspired by her three daughters, Alissa creates stunningly bold vintage looks of organic depth and complexity. One year after our first conversation, Alissa and her girls have a two-page spread in VOGUE magazine. Listen to our most recent chat before diving into our first conversation on the podcast last year."

After losing her corporate job and pursuing any creative opportunity she could to make ends meet, Treasure enrolled in fashion design school to discover her next step. After drawing and draping classes and proving gatekeepers wrong, she found her passion: handbags.\n \nSince then, she has transformed her passion and entrepreneurial spirit into Nikki&Mallory, an artisan-made collection and brand of handcrafted leather goods. Tune in to hear how Treasure found the light inside herself and used it to transcend a dark time. It\u2019s not about grinding and non-stop hustle, but tuning out the world and embarking on a journey to find what feeds your soul.\n\n\n"

The two also discuss creating design opportunities from mistakes, how sewing even liberated her to make her own clothes and navigating being a Black artist in today\u2019s social media age. While Hewett\u2019s work was initially centered around stationary, her path changed when her first printed bags went viral. She has not looked back since, continually adding to her repertoire of accomplishments, including her upcoming novel (featuring someone you may know!) This Long Thread: Women of Color on Craft, Community, and Connection, to be released in Summer 2021. \n\nPATREON exclusive: Supporters get access to the video version of this episode. \n\n\n"

So, everyday I get to be a Therapist is a day that is both meaningful, and heavy to me. Sewing, on the other hand provides me with the freedom to be myself. It gives me a space to make mistakes and say exactly what I have to say, in the way I want to say it without consequence. That experience is so meaningful to my emotional and mental health. I have been a Marriage and Family Therapist, in private practice for 10 years By far, branching out on my own to become an entrepreneur of a sustainable business has been an awe inspiring event for me. Over the years, I/my business has been featured in publications like Parenting Magazine, Heart and Soul magazine, Counseling Today magazine, but my greatest accomplishment is the work that happens behind closed doors, with my people. I have only been sewing for 5 years but my sewing journey has provided me with so many opportunities to learn who I really am through the process of building my own self-esteem. I never would have imagined that 5 years ago, when my client gifted me an old sewing machine of hers, that I would become a Janome maker, be featured in Sewn magazine, have an opportunity to speak on a sewing related podcast or even become a coalition member of Black Makers Matter. I have learned that my perspective matters and I don't want to squander the opportunity to positively affect people, either through sewing or through my therapeutic intervention. To me, there is nothing more meaningful than that!\"</p><p>Her upcoming project is the relaunch of Relationship Rocket Science: I am so excited to be relaunching my Relationship Rocket Science brand which is geared toward teaching people how to create the lives they want through their relationships. I am an educator at heart, so it is very important to me that my people walk away from me with tools and skills that will allow them to execute what they have learned successfully.

I put my family and job ahead of my own needs, got real efficient at \"running shit\", and further away from my creativity. Garment sewing and writing stories about it on my blog had become my main self-care practice because it was freeing me from an adulthood of ill-fitting ready-to-wear (I am short and curvy) and fully engaged my brain and hands in something meant just for me. When I stopped keeping and making sewing promises to myself, I was determined to find out why and began a quiet journey of self-examination. I re-read the book by bell hooks that saved me in college, Sisters of the Yam: Black Women & Self-Recovery and began some much needed inner work and healing. The process is on-going. When the pandemic hit, I was triggered back into SBM mode. This time I recognized it! Those lost sewjo feelings were my call to action. I reached out to the sewing community, found out I wasn't alone and started writing, plugging holes in my self-care, and therapy-sewing my way out of the shadows. I called it my Sewjo Reclamation Project and immediately created my first sewing social media meme with an image from the movie, How Stella Got Her Groove Back. From there, I decided to self-publish my first writings as a for-profit ebook instead of on my blog. This is a transition for my platform that aligned with my 2019 transition to independent consulting from 20 years in the tech industry.

Deborah uses different types of media in her work to form magical and actual glimpses into the interior lives of Black women. These visual spaces show Black women as vulnerable, strong, fragile, bold, comfortable in our own skin, and free to express a full range of emotion. We talk about the relationships between art and craft, and consider the joys of sewing and other creative expressions. "

Social Distancing remains in effect for many in the United States and across the globe as a result of COVID19 or coronovirus.  Some are making virtual connections to reduce feelings of isolation in quarantine, while others are building upon digital networks that they already had. Tune in to hear about how sewing has changed in some ways and yet the joy in the craft persists with creative solutions. "

                "summary": "COVID-19 or Coronavirus has made its way closer to home. Lisa's work as a university professor has shifted to online instruction only. All events--including the university's graduation, Lisa's epic \"50 and Fresh Out of F*cks\" Birthday Party in Las Vegas, her trip to Craftcation in April--have ALL been cancelled. (Links for birthday gift donations in the Episode Notes!)  Her law librarian husband is working from home three days a week. Her high schooler is at home periodt.  And even her college student has reclaimed The Podcast Studio (formerly known as \"his bedroom\")! These inconveniences pale in comparison to the life-or-death situations faced regularly by the nation's health care workers in this pandemic.  Lisa talks about making what health care providers call PPE, personal protective equipment. Calls for sewists to make masks are increasing. Patterns, sew-a-longs, tutorials, online classes--some paid, others for free--are on the rise. Lisa explores the construction, benefits, liability, and ethical issues in the push for homemade masks. The episode includes commentary from a nurse currently providing care in the context of COVID9. Special thanks to Shanail for her generously sharing her opinions with us and for her work to keep people healthy."

SJSA helps young people create quilt art that reflects their reality and hopes about the most pressing social issues of our time. SJSA will exhibit quilts at the National Quilt Museum in Paducah, KY from January 10 to March 10, 2020. The museum also invited  SJSA to contribute a quilt block for their ongoing Block of the Month challenge. Each block reflects a museum exhibit. When the SJSA block was posted to the Block of the Month Facebook page on January 1st, the reaction swiftly revealed that white fragility is widespread in quilting, sewing, and maker spaces. Lisa analyzes this reaction and shares action steps to support the SJSA's young artists (including a chance for a free printout on her favorite foundation paper!)."

It often translates to \"go back and get it,\" though other translations are also popular. In general, Sankofa reflects the idea of learning from the past. \"Remembering our past to protect our future\" and \"Go back to the past and bring forward what is useful\" are two examples of this. The word is visually represented by two Adinkra symbols.  One symbol is of a bird with its feet facing forward, its head turned back to retrieve an egg. The second symbol is of a styled heart.\n\nToday's episode looks back at the origins of Black Women Stitch, some of our 2019 events, and what we are excited about in 2020.  \n"

The wage/income gap for Black women is a staggering example of how racism and sexism combine to do harm. But rather than give you an economic analysis that you could easily find on your own, we are doing our part to elevate black women owned sewing and crafting businesses. In this episode, we center the voices of Black women makers as they talk about their work. So. When you\u2019re shopping next week for Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday, remember these creative ventures and #payblackwomen\n"
