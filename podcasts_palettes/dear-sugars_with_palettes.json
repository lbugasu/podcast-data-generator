I\u2019ve married and had children with two addicts,\u201d begins a letter signed by \u201cMommy Messed Up.\u201d Over the years, her second husband began to withdraw and stash money inside of old bottles. Now Mommy Messed Up is ready to end their toxic relationship. The only problem is she\u2019ll have to disrupt her children\u2019s lives for a second time. \u201cI\u2019m fine with breaking my own heart,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut how do I break my boys\u2019 hearts?\u201d\n\nIn this second part of our series on moving on, the Sugars discuss how we can release ourselves from our past mistakes. Dr. Harriet Lerner drops in to answer a second letter from a woman who is haunted by her abortion, a decision she laments now that she\u2019s experiencing early menopause. Like Mommy Messed Up, she is ruled by her regret.\n\n\u201cWe have to beware of the stories that we tell about ourselves because we become them,\u201d Dr. Lerner advises. \u201cAnd a story like the one she\u2019s constructed is so narrow and fixed that it\u2019s going to edge out all other stories about her past and her present and her future possibilities.\u201d\n\nDr. Lerner is a leading voice on the psychology of women and family relationships. She\u2019s the author of 12 books including The New York Times best seller \u201cThe Dance of Anger\u201d and most recently, \u201cWhy Won\u2019t You Apologize? Healing Big Betrayals and Everyday Hurts.\u201dhttps://www.harrietlerner.com/interviews-articles",

A Black woman is dating a white man who is unwilling to talk about race issues, claiming that she\u2019s \u201ctoo sensitive.\u201d Another woman\u2019s boyfriend, a Christian, is having second thoughts about dating her because she\u2019s an atheist. The Sugars tackle these issues and more, and weigh in on which can be ironed out and which should be deal breakers.",
