    "description": "Huberman Lab discusses neuroscience \u2014 how our brain and its connections with the organs of our body control our perceptions, our behaviors, and our health. We also discuss existing and emerging tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works.\nAndrew Huberman, Ph.D., is a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology, and by courtesy, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills and cognitive functioning.\u00a0\nHuberman\u00a0is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award, given to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision, in 2017. His lab\u2019s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. He also works on neural regeneration and directs a clinical trial to promote visual restoration in diseases that cause blindness.\u00a0Huberman is also actively involved in developing tools now in use by the elite military in the U.S. and Canada, athletes, and technology industries to optimize performance in high stress environments, enhance neural plasticity, mitigate stress and optimize sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\nWork from the\u00a0Huberman\u00a0Laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine has been published in top journals including Nature, Science and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover and other top media outlets.\u00a0\nIn 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab podcast. The podcast is frequently ranked in the top 5 of all podcasts globally and is often ranked #1 in the categories of Science, Education, and Health & Fitness.",

We discuss how memory works, what causes diseases of dementia like Alzheimer\u2019s, and science-based strategies to reduce age-related cognitive decline. We also cover the essential role of curiosity and the dopamine-curiosity link that can assist memory formation and neuroplasticity.\nWe then discuss challenges with attention and focus, and how to overcome them, as well as how to manage task-switching and create home and work environments more conducive to cognitive health and longevity. Additionally, we explore the emotional aspect of memories, tools for overcoming rumination, and strategies for reframing past negative experiences.\nThis episode will be of interest to anyone seeking to improve and maintain their cognitive health, focus, and memory across their lifespan, as well as for those struggling with ADHD.\nAccess the full show notes for this episode at hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nDavid Protein: https://davidprotein.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Charan Ranganath\n00:02:06 Sponsors: David, Levels & Waking Up\n00:06:48 Memory: Past, Present & Future; Sleep\n00:13:23 Self, Memory & Age, Neuroplasticity\n00:18:50 Tool: Curiosity & Dopamine\n00:26:55 Dopamine, Forward Movement\n00:33:09 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:22 Dopamine, Learning; Curiosity & Appraisal\n00:40:31 Memory, Hippocampus\n00:43:34 Prefrontal Cortex & Memory, Aging\n00:50:07 Aging, Prefrontal Cortex & Memory; Depression, Rumination\n00:58:53 Sponsor: Function\n01:00:40 Tool: Lifestyle Factors, Minimizing Age-Related Cognitive Decline\n01:09:39 Exercise, Brain Function; ADHD\n01:17:26 Sense of Purpose, Tool: Values, Goals, Navigating ADHD\n01:23:31 Forgetting, Intention vs. Attention\n01:30:10 Tool: Smartphones, Task-Switching, Forgetfulness\n01:36:36 Tool: Pictures, Memories, Intention\n01:45:46 Deep Focus, Dopamine\n01:49:36 Hearing, Vision, Oral Hygiene, Inflammation, Brain Health, Alzheimer\u2019s\n01:59:51 D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\n02:09:00 Serotonin, Reframing Memories, Trauma\n02:19:05 Psychedelics, Neuroplasticity, Perspective, Group Therapy\n02:27:53 Rumination, Trauma, Nostalgia, Narrative\n02:30:30 Music, Pavlov\u2019s Dogz Band\n02:36:27 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer & Disclosures",

            "content": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Teo Soleymani, M.D., a double-board-certified dermatologist and specialist in skin cancer and reconstructive surgery. We discuss science and clinically supported protocols to improve skin health and give your skin a more youthful appearance and structure, reducing premature aging and skin cancer risk.\nWe discuss the impact of sun exposure on skin appearance and aging and the surprising relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer. We explain how mineral-based (inorganic) sunscreens differ from chemical (organic) sunscreens, whether sunscreen can minimize premature skin aging, reduce cancer risk, and if there are any health risks associated with sunscreen use.\nWe discuss skincare routines to significantly improve skin appearance and how to select skincare products. We discuss how caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and stress impact the skin and describe how nutrition and anti-inflammatory diets can improve skin health. We also discuss the causes and treatments for common skin conditions, including dandruff, acne, rosacea, eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo.\nOur conversation also covers topics such as the use of retinoids, laser treatments, red-light phototherapy, supplements, and how to best monitor for skin cancer. This episode provides numerous actionable protocols, most of which are zero-to-low cost, for improving skin health and appearance, reducing cancer risk, and treating skin problems.\nAccess the full show notes for this episode at hubermanlab.com.\nPre-order Andrew's new book, Protocols, at protocolsbook.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Teo Soleymani\n00:01:35 Sponsors: ROKA, Joovv & Helix Sleep\n00:05:45 Skin Turnover; Skin Appearance & Stress\u00a0\n00:13:35 Caffeine, Vasoconstriction & Skin Redness\n00:16:31 Nicotine, Vaping & Skin Appearance\n00:18:37 Alcohol, Skin Health\n00:24:33 Hydration, Fluid Intake & Genetics\n00:26:19 Tool: Selecting a Moisturizer\n00:29:28 Sponsor: AG1\n00:30:40 Puffiness Under Eyes & Cause\n00:32:14 Tool: Skin Cleansing; Frequency, Showers\n00:41:57 Dry & Flaky Scalp, Dandruff\n00:46:09 Cost & Skincare Products\n00:50:20 Tool: Sun Exposure & Skin Health, Mood\n00:56:24 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:57:35 Sunscreens vs. Sunblocks; Mineral-Based (Inorganic) vs. Chemical (Organic) Sunscreen\n01:02:45 Physical Barriers, Sunscreens, Oral Supplements & Skin Cancer\n01:07:27 Skin Cancer, Genetics; Sunscreen, Premature Aging\n01:12:11 Premature Aging & Skincare\n00:15:56 Choose Mineral or Chemical Sunscreen?\n01:20:24 Polypodium Supplement, Sun Exposure, Skin Redness\n01:26:02 Tool: Selecting Mineral-Based Sunscreens\n01:28:30 Chemical Sunscreens & Blood-Brain Barrier\n01:30:13 Nutrition, Gut Microbiome & Skin Health\n01:34:28 Tool: Nutrition for Skin Health, Protein, Anti-Inflammatory; Collagen; Omega-3\n01:42:58 Retinoids vs. Retinol, Skin Appearance\n01:49:45 Laser Resurfacing; Exfoliation, Microdermabrasion\n01:56:52 Red Light Therapy & Phototherapy, Face Masks, Light Panels\n02:04:10 Psoriasis, Phototherapy\n02:10:03 Vitiligo, Immune System & Skin Cancer Risk\n02:15:41 Acne, High Glycemic Index Foods, Dairy\n02:19:38 Rosacea, Types & Treatments\n02:23:00 Eczema, Immune System\n02:25:37 Popping Pimples & Acne Scars; Corticosteroids\n02:30:15 Tattoos; Tool: Monitoring for Skin Cancer, Moles, Annual Exams\n02:36:28 HPV, Cancer & Warts; Vaccine & Cancer Risk\n02:43:31 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer & Disclosures",

We discuss how to evaluate scientific evidence and the validity of different practices aimed at achieving fat loss, muscle strength and hypertrophy, microbiome health, vitality, and longevity.\nWe explore many hotly debated topics, including fasting, seed oils, saturated fats, sugar, red meat, artificial/low-calorie sweeteners, and GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Ozempic). Additionally, we delve into the timing of protein and carbohydrate intake relative to fasting and exercise, fat loss and sleep, and the benefits of dietary protein and fiber on overall health.\nWe also discuss how to accelerate hypertrophy and fat loss, improve strength, whether we need to train to \u201cfailure,\u201d how to enhance exercise recovery, and how to manage pain. We cover training before versus after age 50, whether metabolism changes with age, and the connection between muscle health and longevity.

We discuss which exercise and nutrition protocols are ideal for women based on their age and particular goals.\nWe discuss whether women should train fasted, when and what to eat pre- and post-training, and how the menstrual cycle impacts training and nutrition needs. We also explain how to use a combination of resistance, high-intensity, and sprint interval training to effectively improve body composition, hormones, and cardiometabolic health, offset cognitive decline, and promote longevity.\u00a0\nWe also discuss supplements and caffeine, the unique sleep needs of women based on age, whether women should use deliberate cold exposure, and how saunas can improve symptoms of hot flashes and benefit athletic performance. Dr. Sims challenges common misconceptions about women\u2019s health and fitness and explains why certain types of cardio, caloric restriction, and low-protein diets can be harmful to women\u2019s metabolic health.\nListeners will learn a wealth of actionable information on how to improve their training and nutrition to enhance their health and how to age with greater ability, mobility, and vitality.\nAccess the full show notes for this episode at hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\u00a0\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\u00a0\u00a0\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\u00a0\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Stacy Sims\n00:02:24 Sponsors: Maui Nui, Eight Sleep & Waking Up\n00:07:03 Intermittent Fasting, Exercise & Women\n00:12:50 Cortisol & Circadian Rhythm, Caffeine & Training\n00:17:25 Reps in Reserve, Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE); Age & Women\n00:21:06 Pre-Training Meal & Brain, Kisspeptin\n00:26:45 Post-Training Meal & Recovery Window\n00:29:59 Sponsor: AG1\n00:31:48 Hormones, Calories & Women\n00:34:24 Women, Strength Improvements & Resistance Training\n00:39:10 Tool: Women & Training Goals by Age Range\n00:44:16 Women, Perimenopause, Training & Longevity\n00:47:14 Women & Training for Longevity, Cardio, Zone 2\n00:51:42 Tools: How to Start Resistance Training, Machines; Polarized Training\n00:58:23 Perform with Dr. Andy Galpin Podcast\n00:59:10 Menstrual Cycle & Training, Tool: Tracking & Individual Variability\n01:04:31 Tool: 10-Minute Rule; High-Intensity Training & Menstrual Cycle\n01:08:36 \u201cTrain Hard & Eat Well\u201d; Appetite, Nutrition & Menstrual Cycle\n01:12:22 Oral Contraception, Hormones, Athletic Performance; IUD\n01:20:57 Evaluating Menstrual Blood, PCOS; Hormones & Female Athletes\n01:26:31 Iron, Fatigue; Blood Testing & Menstrual Cycle\n01:29:33 Caffeine & Perimenopause; Nicotine, Schisandra\n01:34:24 Deliberate Cold Exposure & Women, Endometriosis; Tool: Sauna & Hot Flashes\n01:42:19 Tools: \u201cSims\u2019 Protocol\u201d: Post-Training Sauna & Performance; \u201cTrack Stack\u201d\n01:49:37 Women, Hormones & Sleep, Perimenopause & Sleep Hygiene\n01:52:54 Supplements: Creatine, Water Weight, Hair Loss; Vitamin D3\n01:57:21 Protein Powder; Adaptogens & Timing\n02:00:11 Pregnancy & Training; Cold & Hot Exposure\n02:06:19 Tool: Women in 50s & Older, Training & Nutrition for Longevity\n02:09:38 Tool: Women in 20s-40s & Training, Lactate\n02:12:18 Tool: What is High-Intensity Training?, Cardiovascular Sets & Recovery\n02:17:22 Training for Longevity, Cellular & Metabolic Changes\n02:19:30 Nutrition, 80/20 Rule\n02:23:30 Listening to Self\n02:26:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\u00a0\nDisclaimer & Disclosures",

We discuss the most common sources of back pain, how back pain can be assessed (including self-assessment techniques), and how to design a personalized recovery plan to reduce back pain.\nWe discuss how to train for lifelong fitness, reduce injury risk, and protect your back and joints based on your age and personal goals. We also discuss how to prevent back pain, build core stability, and explain how \u201cMcGill\u2019s Big 3\u201d exercises protect and strengthen the back. Dr. McGill, who is exceptionally fit in his late 60s, describes his low-time investment, personal training routine, and the specific exercises he uses for mobility, strength, and cardiovascular fitness.\nWe also discuss controversial issues in the back pain and rehabilitation field, including how pain originates, the biopsychosocial model of pain, and treatments such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP). This episode provides clear, actionable tools to strengthen, prevent, and remedy back pain and injury so you can be pain-free while enjoying sports, exercise, and daily activities at any age.\nAccess the full show notes for this episode at hubermanlab.com.\nWatch the clip on back pain relief and spine anatomy that accompanies this episode.\nDemonstration of The McGill Method\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Stuart McGill\n00:02:33 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, BetterHelp & Waking Up\n00:06:23 What Causes Back Pain?; Genetics, Dog Breed Analogy\n00:12:55 Tool: Skeleton & Body Type; Spine Flexibility & Discs\n00:20:25 Flexibility & Exercises; Discs & Collagen\n00:25:43 Sponsor: AG1\n00:27:32 Stress & Tipping Point; Athletic Tradeoffs, Triathletes\n00:36:17 Back Pain, Goals & Training Program\n00:45:57 Spine Hygiene, Back Pain, Powerlifting\n00:53:33 Genetics & Running\n00:59:34 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:00:46 Rehabilitation & Reducing Volume; Injury\n01:07:42 Tool: Training for Lifelong Fitness, Injury & Joints\n01:17:40 Pain Types, Biopsychosocial Model of Pain\n01:26:15 Coaching, Explosivity & Endurance\n01:32:43 Virtual Surgery & Rest, Pain Recovery\n01:41:25 Tool: McGill\u2019s Big 3; Building Back Strength & Stability\n01:46:39 Inversion Tables & Spine Deloading, Disc Bulge, Tool: Lumbar Support\n01:51:09 Tool: Daily Walking; Sitting\n01:55:33 Deadlift & Bone Density, Glute-Ham Raise\n02:06:20 Training & Age, Osteoporosis, Tool: Deadlift Alternatives\n02:16:47 Tools: Biblical Training Week; Spine Stability & McGill\u2019s Big 3; Shrinking & Age\n02:24:16 Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP); Disc Damage\n02:27:56 Tools: Biblical Training Week & Strength Exercises, Neck Strength\n02:35:24 Tools: Sword Play, Distal Limb Loading, Training for Symmetry\n02:42:38 Tools: Biblical Training Week, Mobility & Cardiovascular Exercises, Athletic Panel\n02:49:22 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer & Disclosures",

We discuss the most common sources of back pain, how back pain can be assessed (including self-assessment techniques), and how to design a personalized recovery plan to reduce back pain.\nWe discuss how to train for lifelong fitness, reduce injury risk, and protect your back and joints based on your age and personal goals. We also discuss how to prevent back pain, build core stability, and explain how \u201cMcGill\u2019s Big 3\u201d exercises protect and strengthen the back. Dr. McGill, who is exceptionally fit in his late 60s, describes his low-time investment, personal training routine, and the specific exercises he uses for mobility, strength, and cardiovascular fitness.\nWe also discuss controversial issues in the back pain and rehabilitation field, including how pain originates, the biopsychosocial model of pain, and treatments such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP).

We discuss how cannabis affects the brain to produce its psychoactive effects (feeling \u201chigh\u201d), including altered time perception, focus, memory, appetite, and stress.\nWe discuss how THC vs. cannabidiol (CBD) affects the brain, the effects of different routes of cannabis administration (e.g., smoking, vaping, edibles), high-potency THC, and whether cannabis is addictive. We discuss if there is a link between cannabis use and the development of psychosis, anxiety, bipolar depression, or schizophrenia.\u00a0\nWe discuss whether CBD has clinical benefits in regulating stress, promoting sleep, and treating certain diseases.

We also discuss if there are real and consistent differences in the biological effects of different cannabis strains, if cannabis impacts hormones, and the uses of cannabis for the management of pain, stress, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and nausea.\nListeners of this episode will get an up-to-date understanding of what is currently known about how cannabis affects the brain and body, including both its potential benefits and risks.\nAccess the full show notes for this episode at hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Matthew Hill\n00:00:00 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, LMNT & BetterHelp\n00:07:16 Cannabis, THC, Cannabidiol (CBD), Terpenes\n00:12:08 Psychoactive Effects, Cannabis \u201cHigh\u201d; Time Perception\n00:16:55 Cannabis & Brain, CB1 Receptor, Endocannabinoids\n00:26:19 Endocannabinoids Types: Anandamide, 2-AG\n00:33:46 \u201cMunchies\u201d, Cannabis & Appetite\n00:42:17 Sponsor: AG1\n00:44:06 THC & Anandamide, Pharmacology\n00:52:37 THC & CB1 Receptors, Intoxication & Appetite\n00:58:57 Cannabis & Focus, Memory\n01:04:09 Routes of Administration, Concentration, Cannabis Research\n01:15:12 Self-Regulation, Inhalation & THC, Tolerance; THC Concentrates\n01:22:25 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:23:36 Addiction & Cannabis, Cannabis Use Disorder\n01:31:30 Cannabis Legalization & Use, Edibles & ER Visits\n01:36:48 Oral Consumption, Edibles, Dosing & Time Course\n01:41:12 Drug Testing & Cannabis, Exercise\n01:46:04 Cannabis & Hormones, Gynecomastia, Sperm Quality\n01:54:37 Cannabis & Pregnancy; Selling Recreational Cannabis\n02:04:07 Vaping\n02:07:05 Psychosis, Anxiety & Cannabis\n02:17:17 Cannabis, Psychosis, Schizophrenia & Genetics\n02:30:45 Cannabis Use & Schizophrenia, Manic Bipolar, THC Potency, Nicotine\n02:40:37 Schizophrenia, Cannabis Legalization\n02:45:06 Cannabis Strains, Indica, Sativa, Subjective Effects & Expectancy Bias\n02:57:00 CBD, Pediatric Epilepsy, Adenosine\n03:07:22 Entourage Effect; Placebo Effect, CBD & Doses\n03:19:12 Cannabis Health Risks, Cardiovascular Risk, Schizophrenia\u00a0\n03:27:08 Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome & Hot Shower\n03:31:30 Cannabis Benefits: Pain, Stress, Anxiety, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n03:40:18 Cannabis & Anxiety, Anandamide & Stress Response\n03:45:55 Scientific Discussion, Clarification & Advancement\n03:49:47 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer",

I review the data on ingesting (or topically applied) collagen, vitamin C, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and retinol, and what is known about the use of peptides (e.g., BPC-157, copper peptides) and red and far-red light phototherapies for improving skin health and appearance.\nI also discuss the causes of acne, rosacea, and psoriasis and explain nutritional, skin care, and prescription-based approaches to treating these common skin conditions.\nThis episode ought to help everyone better understand the biology of the skin and help them make the best possible decisions for their skin health, care, and appearance according to age, goals, and current skin conditions.\nAccess the full show notes, including referenced articles, books, people mentioned, and additional resources at hubermanlab.com.\nAndrew's New Book\nProtocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body: https://protocolsbook.com\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\u00a0\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\u00a0\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\u00a0\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Skin Health\n00:02:59 Sponsors: Joovv, BetterHelp & ROKA\u00a0\n00:07:18 Skin Biology, Skin Layers\n00:12:40 Sun Exposure, UV Light & Skin Cancers; Sunscreen\n00:19:51 Aging, Sun Exposure, Skin Cancers, Physical Barriers\n00:27:24 Sunburn & Skin Cancers\n00:30:09 Sponsor: AG1\n00:31:58 Vitamin D, Sun Exposure & Sunscreen\n00:36:50 Organic (Chemical) Sunscreen & Inorganic (Mineral-Based) Sunscreen\n00:49:20 Skin Cancers, Moles, Laser Resurfacing\n00:53:59 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:55:34 Sun Exposure, Melanoma & Life Expectancy\n01:03:13 Tool: Youthful Skin, Collagen & Vitamin C\n01:12:55 Peptides, BPC-157, Copper\n01:20:58 Tool: Niacinamide (Nicotinamide), Youthful Skin, Dark Spots, Hyaluronic Acid\n01:26:25 Tool: Retinol (Retin-A, Tretinoin, Retinyl Esters), Youthful Skin\n01:33:07 Tool: Phototherapy, Youthful Skin, Treating Skin Conditions\n01:41:10 Tool: Nutrition for Skin Health, Anti-Inflammatory Diets\n01:47:54 Highly Processed Foods, Advanced Glycation End Products & Skin Health\n01:52:08 Tools: Reduce Inflammation: Gut Microbiome, Sleep, Alcohol, Smoking, Stress\n01:58:58 Acne, Hormones & Insulin; Tool: Low Glycemic Diet, Dairy\n02:07:26 Tools: Face Cleansing & Acne; Scarring & Popping Pimples\n02:13:29 Tool: Treating Rosacea, Alcohol, Skin Care, Nutrition\n02:18:31 Stubborn Rosacea, Over Cleansing, Pulsed Dye Laser\n02:21:04 Psoriasis Treatment, Immune System & Prescriptions\n02:25:24 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer",

She is also an expert in how diet and exercise impact muscle and whole-body health and longevity. Dr. Lyon is a bestselling author and public educator. We discuss how healthy skeletal muscle promotes longevity, brain health, disease prevention, ideal body composition, and the health of other organs and bodily systems.\nShe makes specific nutritional recommendations for optimal health: what to eat, how much to eat, the timing of meals, the essential need for adequate quality protein (including animal and plant-based options), supplementation, and how our dietary requirements change with age. She explains why specific types of resistance training are essential to build and maintain muscle and overall metabolic health. She also describes how to include resistance training as part of your exercise regimen \u2014 regardless of age or sex.\u00a0\nShe also provides specific mindset tools to encourage sustained adherence to healthy eating and exercise practices. Women and men of all ages will benefit from Dr. Lyon\u2019s practical, evidence-based protocols to improve muscle and whole-body appearance, function, and health.\nAccess the full show notes, including referenced articles, books, people mentioned, and additional resources at hubermanlab.com.\nAndrew's New Book\nProtocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body: https://protocolsbook.com\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\u00a0\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\u00a0\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\u00a0\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Protocols Book; Dr. Gabrielle Lyon\n00:03:23 Sponsors: Maui Nui, Levels & Helix Sleep\n00:07:40 Skeletal Muscle & Longevity\n00:11:25 \u201cUnder-muscled\u201d, Leucine & Muscle Health\n00:15:55 Muscle Health\n00:19:45 Tool: Carbohydrate Consumption & Activity, Glycogen\n00:25:14 Tools: Nutrition for Healthy Skeletal Muscle, First Meal\n00:31:57 Sponsor: AG1\n00:33:46 Quality Protein, Animal & Plant-Based Proteins\n00:37:36 Dietary Protein Recommendations, Meal Threshold\n00:41:19 Muscle Health & Aging\n00:46:02 Supplements & Creatine; Dietary Protein\n00:50:07 Tool: Dietary Protein Recommendation; Gout & Cancer Risk\n00:52:43 Effects of Dietary Protein & Exercise on Body Composition\n01:03:06 Thermic Effects, Protein\u00a0\n01:05:02 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:06:14 Protein & Satiety, Insulin & Glucose\n01:12:04 Tool: Older Adults, Resistance Training & Dietary Protein\n01:17:48 Dietary Protein, mTOR & Cancer Risk\n01:21:36 Muscle Span & Aging, Sedentary Behaviors\n01:24:00 Mixed Meals, Protein Quality, Fiber\n01:29:21 Inactivity & Insulin Resistance, Inflammation\n01:38:43 Exercise & Myokines, Brain Health & BDNF\n01:44:11 Tool: Resistance Training Protocols, Hypertrophy, \u201cHigh Ground\u201d\n01:52:51 High Ground Exercises; Tendon Strength; Training Duration, Blue Zones\n01:58:19 Movement, Exercise & Older Adults\n02:04:25 Tool: Protein Timing & Resistance Training; VO2 Max, Aging, Blood Work\n02:11:13 Supplements: Creatine, Urolithin A, Whey Protein, Fish Oil, Collagen\n02:20:18 Fasting, Older Adults; Tool: Meal Timing\n02:25:18 Animal Proteins & Dairy; Organ Meats, Vegan; Magnesium, Zinc\n02:30:59 Medications & Muscle Health\n02:32:49 Obesity & GLP-1 Analogs, Ozempic, Mounjaro, Skeletal Muscle\n02:40:48 Benefits of Skeletal Muscle & Aging\n02:42:16 Tools: Nutrition & Resistance Training for Muscle Health\n02:45:44 Mindset Tools: Standards vs. Goals; Vulnerability Points\n02:52:00 Mindset Tools: Neutrality; Health & Worth\n03:01:14 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter, Protocols Book\nDisclaimer"

            "content": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Diego Boh\u00f3rquez, PhD, professor of medicine and neurobiology at Duke University and a pioneering researcher into how we use our \u2018gut sense.\u2019 He describes how your gut communicates to your brain and the rest of your body through hormones and neural connections to shape your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. He explains how your gut senses a range of features such as temperature, pH, the macro- and micronutrients in our foods, and much more and signals that information to the brain to affect our food preferences, aversions, and cravings.\nDr. Boh\u00f3rquez describes his early life in the Amazon jungle and how exposure to traditional agriculture inspired his unique expertise combining nutrition, gastrointestinal physiology, and neuroscience.

Dr. Hollis is also an expert in the psychology of relationships and healing from trauma. We discuss how early family dynamics and social context create patterns of both adaptive and maladaptive behavior and internal narratives that, when examined, lead to better choices and a deeply fulfilling existence.\nWe discuss discovering your unique self-identity and purpose through specific practices of reflection, meditation and conversations with others. We also discuss self-perception and the evolution of roles within marriages, parent-child relationships, and work.\nThroughout the episode, Dr. Hollis provides both basic knowledge and practical tools to help us assess ourselves and better understand who we are and what we really want in careers, relationships of all kinds, and society.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMate\u00edna: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. James Hollis\n00:02:14 Sponsors: Mateina, Joovv & BetterHelp\n00:05:57 Self, Ego, Sense of Self\n00:13:59 Unconscious Patterns, Blind Spots, Dreams; Psyche & Meaning\n00:21:56 Second Half of Life, Purpose, Depression\n00:25:37 Sponsor: AG1\n00:27:08 Tool: Daily Reflection; Crisis\n00:31:47 Families & Children, Permission & Burdens\n00:37:27 Complex Identification, Self-Perception; Social Media & Borderline\n00:41:55 Daily Stimulus Response, Listening to the Soul\n00:45:40 Exiting Stimulus-Response, Loneliness, Burnout\n00:51:19 Meditation & Perception, Reflection\n00:54:58 Sponsor: Waking Up\n00:56:15 Recognizing the \u201cShadow\u201d & Adulthood\n01:02:48 Socialization; Family & Life Journey\n01:09:04 Relationships & \u201cOtherness\u201d, Standing Your Ground\n01:15:51 Marriage, \u201cStarter Marriages\u201d & Evolution; Parenting\n01:19:37 Shadow Issues, Success & External Reward, Personal Growth\n01:27:59 Men, Alcohol, \u201cStoic Man\u201d, Loneliness, Fear & Longing\n01:37:33 Women & Men, Focused vs. Diffuse Awareness; Male Rite of Passage\n01:44:31 Sacrifice, Relationships; Facing Fears\n01:48:20 Therapy, \u201cAbyss of the Self\u201d, Repeating Patterns & Stories\n01:55:17 Women, Career & Family, Partner Support; Redefining Roles\n02:01:40 Pathology & Diagnosis, Internet\n02:07:05 Life, Suffering & Accountability, \u201cSwamplands\u201d & Task\n02:11:32 Abuse & Recovery of Self, Patience, Powerlessness\n02:14:11 Living a Larger Life; \u201cShut Up, Suit Up, Show Up\u201d\n02:17:49 Life Stages; Despair & Integrity Conflict\n02:25:00 Death, Ego, Mortality & Meaning\n02:38:07 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer",

We also cover how childhood development and aging affect sleep biology and needs. We also discuss whether polyphasic sleep (multiple short sleep periods) is beneficial.\u00a0\nThen, we discuss naps, including their positive benefits, individual variability, those who should not nap, and alternative rest states like non-sleep deep rest. Dr. Walker shares protocols to optimize nap duration, timing and effectiveness.\nWe also explore the effects of caffeine on sleep and other health aspects, as well as the optimal timing for caffeine intake.\nThis episode describes many actionable science-based tools for optimizing sleep, naps and caffeine use for better health and performance.\nThe next episode in this special series explores the relationship between sleep, memory, and creativity.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Sleep Structure\n(00:01:29) Sponsors: BetterHelp, LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:05:42) Sleep Phases & Lifespan\n(00:11:58) Sleep Stages & Lifespan, Sleep Paralysis & Animals\n(00:20:19) Adults & Biphasic Sleep, Modern Society\n(00:25:14) Chronotype, Circadian Rhythms & Biological Flexibility\n(00:29:07) Genetics & Chronotype\n(00:31:42) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:32:55) Biphasic Sleep, Adults; Body Position & Sleepiness\n(00:40:09) Naps, Positive Benefits, Nighttime Insomnia\n(00:49:38) Tool: Optimal Nap: Duration & Timing; Grogginess\n(00:58:15) Nap Capacity, \u201cLiminal\u201d States & NSDR\n(01:07:37) NASA Nap Culture, Power Naps\n(01:11:49) Sponsor: Eight Sleep\n(01:12:50) Tools: Nap Timing, \u201cFragile\u201d Nighttime Sleep; On-Off-On Protocol\n(01:18:57) Avoiding Naps: Insomnia, Aging & Sleep Quality Decline\n(01:28:20) Caffeine, \u201cNappuccino\u201d; Hot Drinks\n(01:38:28) Adenosine Clearance, Sleep\u00a0\n(01:43:10) Tool: Delaying Caffeine, Afternoon Crash, Sleep Quality\n(01:49:06) Caffeine, Health, Antioxidants; Caffeine Tolerance & Alcohol\n(01:56:54) Tool: Nap \u201cEnhancements\u201d, Caffeine, Light & Face Washing\n(02:04:33) Polyphasic Sleep, Adverse Effects\n(02:12:43) Sleep Deprivation & Car Crashes; Polyphasic Sleep\n(02:16:49) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer",

I also discuss peptide sourcing, dosages, cycling, routes of administration, and how peptides work in combination.\u00a0\nThis episode will help you better understand the rapidly expanding landscape of peptide therapeutics and how to evaluate if specific peptides might be advantageous towards achieving your physical or mental health goals.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMate\u00edna: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Peptides\n(00:03:20) Sponsors: Mateina, Levels & Joovv\n(00:07:44) What is a Peptide?\n(00:12:06) Peptide Sourcing, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\n(00:14:48) Rejuvenation & Tissue Repair: BPC-157, Angiogenesis\n(00:21:50) BPC-157 & Tissue Injury; Mode of Delivery\n(00:27:53) BPC-157: Safety, Doses, Cycling, Tumor Risk\n(00:35:16) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:36:43) Tissue Repair: Thymosin Beta-4, TB-500\n(00:40:49) Growth & Metabolism: Growth Hormone, IGF-1, Risks\n(00:45:25) Secretagogues, Sermorelin, Tesamorelin, CJC-1295\n(00:52:21) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:53:44) Ipamorelin, Hexarelin, GHRP-3, MK-677; Risks & Timing\n(00:58:69) Peptides for Growth Hormone & IGF-1, Risk; Combinations & Dosing\n(01:06:12) Longevity: Thymosin Beta-4, Epitalon (Epithalon)\n(01:12:09) Vitality: Melanotan, PT-141 (Vyleesi), Risks\n(01:17:21) Vitality: Kisspeptin\n(01:21:46) Peptides, Potential Benefits, Side-Effects & Risks\n(01:24:19) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer"

He's one of the world\u2019s top magicians and mentalists.\u00a0\nWe discuss what magic and mentalism reveal about the human mind, including how memories are made, how to erase them, and how and why we perceive things the way we do, all in the context of how he performs his astonishing tricks.\u00a0\nAsi explains that magic works because it involves storytelling, which is key to how we organize memories. He also explains how emotional connection allows people to co-create and believe a common narrative, even one that did not actually occur.\u00a0\nWe also discuss how Asi's love of painting and photography and his specific daily routine allow him to access creativity. We also discuss fear, perfectionism, and how feeling emotions deeply serves his craft.\u00a0\nWhether you are interested in magic or not, this conversation with Asi will give you an incredible window into how you perceive, learn, and remember the world around you and how what you believe may or may not be based in reality.\u00a0\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\u00a0\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\u00a0\nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman\u00a0\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\u00a0\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Asi Wind\n(00:02:48) Sponsors: LMNT, BetterHelp & AeroPress\n(00:07:07) \u201cJazzy Magic\u201d, Tricks & Improvisation, Memory\n(00:14:57) Magic & Imagination\n(00:24:06) Memory \u201cExperiments\u201d\n(00:29:18) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:30:46) Reality Augmentation, Free Will\n(00:35:31) Audience Interactions & Connection, Empathy, Tool: Breathing\n(00:41:20) Audience, Empathetic Attunement & Connection; Skeptics\n(00:49:10) Trick Explanation, Props\n(00:57:21) Exposing Magic, Misdirection, Storytelling\n(01:07:29) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:08:36) Delight, Hypnosis, Behavior Patterns\n(01:17:35) Hypnotists & Guiding Attention; Social Media\n(01:23:01) \u201cPower of Pauses\u201d & Memory; Tool: Gap Effects & Learning\n(01:30:14) Tension, Understanding Magic\n(01:36:16) Storytelling\n(01:43:00) Painting & Composition\n(01:51:08) Truths, Clean Slate, Art & Storytelling\n(01:59:03) Art & Motivation, Honesty\n(02:05:17) Inspiration & Creativity, \u201cSponge\u201d\n(02:12:38) Morning Routine & Creativity\n(02:19:28) Memory & Fear, Power of Story; Tool: Walking & Creativity\n(02:29:53) Body Language\n(02:33:01) Perfectionism; Negative Emotions, Photography\n(02:40:19) Sensitivity, Empathy, Family\n(02:45:16) Incredibly Human Show\n(02:49:22) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer",

I discuss how your beliefs and expectation that a certain outcome will occur after taking a substance (or any intervention cause genuine changes in brain and bodily function. I discuss how placebos can change neurotransmitter and hormone release, pain levels, whether the stress response is beneficial or detrimental and more. I also explain how placebo effects can work with traditional drug or behavioral treatments to help improve health outcomes and why some people are more susceptible to placebo effects. By the end of the episode, listeners will understand the placebo effect, how it works, and how beliefs and mindsets can be leveraged toward mental health, physical health, and performance goals.\u00a0\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Placebo Effects\n(00:02:40) Sponsors: Eight Sleep, AeroPress & Levels\n(00:07:24) Placebo, Nocebo vs. Belief Effect, Prefrontal Cortex\n(00:14:03) Dopamine, Placebo & Parkinson\u2019s Disease; Placebo Controls\n(00:21:36) Hormone Release & Placebo Effect, Paired Associations\n(00:28:52) Conditioning Effect & Insulin; Pavlovian Response\n(00:32:50) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:34:17) Context & Expectations; Placebo Effect & Brain\n(00:40:51) Cancer, Mind-Body Practices; Placebo Effects & Limits\n(00:44:54) Asthma, Specificity & Placebo Effects\n(00:48:01) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(00:49:03) Nicotine & Dose-Dependent Placebo Effects\n(00:55:31) Placebo Effects vs. Belief Effects, Food & Mindset\n(01:01:02) Exercise & Belief Effects\n(01:04:08) Placebo Effect, Brain & Stress Response\n(01:11:18) Individual Variation, Genetics & Placebo Effect\n(01:16:11) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer"

                "summary": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Mark D'Esposito, M.D., a neurologist and professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying cognition and the forms of memory required for focus, productivity, planning and achieving goals, and learning. We discuss neurochemicals such as dopamine and acetylcholine and how they can be leveraged to improve cognitive functioning. We also discuss concussion, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease, and ways to restore or slow cognitive decline by using pharmacologic, lifestyle and behavioral protocols. This episode provides a modern understanding of cognition and memory and actionable tools to optimize brain health and function.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Mark D\u2019Esposito\n(00:02:08) Sponsors: Maui Nui, Joovv & Eight Sleep\n(00:06:23) Brain & Frontal Lobes, Prefrontal Cortex, Executive Function\n(00:10:31) Frontal Lobe Development, Children\n(00:14:12) Rules, Context & Impulse Control; Learning & Goals\n(00:21:45) Focus, Improving Executive Function\n(00:26:04) Connections & Top-Down Signals\n(00:29:02) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:30:29) Frontal Lobe Injury; Emotional Regulation\n(00:37:26) Smartphones, Social Media\n(00:44:37) Working Memory, Dopamine\n(00:52:59) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:54:22) Dopamine Levels & Working Memory, Cognitive Tasks, Genetics\n(01:00:03) Bromocriptine & Working Memory, Dopamine\n(01:06:21) Guanfacine, Neurotransmitter Levels, Pupil Dilation & Biomarker Tests\n(01:12:46) Bromocriptine, Olympics; Pharmacology & Cognitive Function, Adderall\n(01:19:27) Concussion, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n(01:25:22) Sleep, TBI, Concussion & Executive Function; BrainHQ\n(01:31:57) Aging & Frontal Executive System; Brain Health\n(01:39:26) Tools: Brain Health & Boosting Executive Function, Books\n(01:47:26) Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Genetics, Pharmacology\n(01:51:48) Parkinson\u2019s Disease, L-Dopa; Coping with Alzheimer\u2019s; Nicotine\n(01:58:37) Estrogen & Dopamine, Cognition; Tool: Physical Exercise\n(02:04:43) Tool: Mindfulness Meditation & Executive Function\n(02:10:31) Brain Networks; Modularity\n(02:17:08) Modularity, Brain Indices\n(02:22:53) Psilocybin; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation\n(02:30:16) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer"

We also discuss effective protocols for controlling and reducing pain, including the use of heat and cold, acupuncture, chiropractic, physical therapy, nutrition, and supplementation.\nWe also discuss how pain is influenced by our emotions, stress and memories, and practical tools to control one\u2019s psychological perception of pain.\nAnd we discuss pain medications, including the controversial use of opioids and the opioid crisis.\nThis episode will help people understand, manage, and control their pain as well as the pain of others.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Sean Mackey\n(00:02:28) Sponsors: LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:06:13) Pain, Unique Experiences, Chronic Pain\n(00:13:05) Pain & the Brain\n(00:16:15) Treating Pain, Medications: NSAIDs & Analgesics\n(00:22:46) Inflammation, Pain & Recovery; Ibuprofen, Naprosyn & Aspirin\n(00:27:51) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:30:19) Caffeine, NSAIDs, Tylenol\n(00:32:34) Pain & Touch, Gate Control Theory\n(00:38:56) Pain Threshold, Gender\n(00:44:53) Pain in Children, Pain Modulation (Pain Inhibits Pain)\n(00:53:20) Tool: Heat, Cold & Pain; Changing Pain Threshold\n(01:00:54) Tools: Psychology, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, Catastrophizing\n(01:08:29) Tool: Hurt vs. Harmed?, Chronic Pain\n(01:12:38) Emotional Pain, Anger, Medication\n(01:20:43) Tool: Nutrition & Pain; Food Sensitization & Elimination Diets\n(01:28:45) Visceral Pain; Back, Chest & Abdominal Pain\n(01:34:02) Referenced Pain, Neuropathic Pain; Stress, Memory & Psychological Pain\n(01:40:23) Romantic Love & Pain, Addiction\n(01:48:57) Endogenous & Exogenous Opioids, Morphine\n(01:53:17) Opioid Crisis, Prescribing Physicians\n(02:02:21) Opioids & Fentanyl; Morphine, Oxycontin, Methadone\n(02:07:44) Kratom, Cannabis, CBD & Pain; Drug Schedules\n(02:18:12) Pain Management Therapies, Acupuncture\n(02:22:19) Finding Reliable Physicians, Acupuncturist\n(02:26:36) Chiropractic & Pain Treatment; Chronic Pain & Activity\n(02:31:35) Physical Therapy & Chronic Pain; Tool: Pacing\n(02:36:35) Supplements: Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin C, Creatine\n(02:42:25) Pain Management, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Biofeedback\n(02:48:32) National Pain Strategy, National Pain Care Act\n(02:54:05) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors,\u00a0Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer"

This episode is a recording of a live stream AMA, originally exclusive to our Annual and Lifetime Members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.\nHuberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast \u2014 which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\nIf you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more.

            "content": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Robert Lustig, M.D., neuroendocrinologist, professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and a bestselling author on nutrition and metabolic health. We address the \u201ccalories in- calories out\u201d (CICO) model of metabolism and weight regulation and how specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), fiber and sugar can modify the CICO equation. We cover how different types of sugars, specifically fructose, sugars found in liquid form, taste intensity, and other factors impact insulin levels, liver, kidney, and metabolic health. We also explore how fructose in non-fruit sources can be addictive (acting similarly to drugs of abuse) and how sugar alters brain circuits related to food cravings and satisfaction. We discuss the role of sugar in childhood and adult obesity, gut health and disease and mental health.

We discuss how to find, pursue and achieve one\u2019s unique life purpose, and how to best learn from good and hard experiences along that journey. We discuss power dynamics in relationships, the different types of human communication and the interplay between seduction and vulnerability.

            "content": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Adam Grant, Ph.D., a professor of organizational psychology at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, an expert in the science and practical steps for increasing motivation, maximizing and reaching our potential, and understanding how individuals and groups can best flourish. He is also an avid public educator, having written five bestselling books, delivered several top-ranking TED Talks and is the host of two psychology podcasts. We discuss how to overcome procrastination, how to increase intrinsic motivation (even for dreaded tasks), identify blind spots and rethink our assumptions, and how we can build a persistent growth mindset. We also explain tools to improve creativity and discuss the surprising relationship between creativity and procrastination. We then explore how to effectively solicit useful feedback and grow from constructive criticism and how you can improve your level of focus and attention using science-supported methods. We also discuss mental tools to get out of negative thought spirals, how to nurture potential in yourself or others, and the dark side of perfectionism. The discussion delivers more than a dozen science-supported protocols that are readily applicable to anyone seeking to live a more productive, fulfilling, and creative life.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Adam Grant\n(00:01:53) Sponsors: LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:05:56) Procrastination & Emotion; Curiosity\n(00:14:06) Creativity & Procrastination; Motivation\n(00:20:48) Intrinsic Motivation & Curiosity\n(00:27:59) Tool: Tasks & Sense of Purpose\n(00:29:34) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:32:34) Extrinsic Rewards, Choice; Social Media\n(00:42:24) Tool: \u201cQuiet Time\u201d Protocol, Chronotypes\n(00:49:20) Tool: Creativity: Mornings, Movement, Stillness\n(00:58:14) Tools: Ideas & Filtering, Feedback & Opinions, Advice\n(01:07:15) Tool: Constructive Criticism, \u201cSecond Score\u201d; Verbs\n(01:14:40) Tool: Growth Mindsets, Scaffolding; Job Innovation\n(01:21:50) Tools: Task Sequencing & Intrinsic Motivation; Tapering & Frame of Reference\n(01:30:03) Tools: Momentum, Confidence & Domains; Negative Thought Spirals\n(01:36:16) Tool: Phone & \u201cTo Don\u2019t\u201d List; Writing Ideas\n(01:39:54) Tool: Bias Blindspot, Reflected Best-Self Portrait\n(01:45:36) Helping Others, Synthesizing Information\n(01:50:24) Modes of Thinking, Blind Spots & Assumptions\n(01:56:10) Thinking Like a Scientist: Hypothesis-Testing & Discourse, Social Media\n(02:05:150 Tool: Authenticity, Sincerity & Etiquette, \u201cSnapshot\u201d & Online Presence\n(02:12:49) Realizing Potential: Motivation, Opportunity & Process\n(02:21:53) Skills to Realize Potential, Perfectionism\n(02:27:52) Tool: Early Success & Performance Cycle, \u201cFailure Budget\u201d\n(02:31:56) Future Projects, Complex Issues & Challenging Ideas\n(02:40:10) Artistic Hobbies, Magicians\n(02:45:55) Science Communication, Interest & Self-Relevance\n(02:52:16) Languishing, Descriptive Language & Emotions\n(03:00:09) Tool: Nurture Potential in Children, \u201cCoach Effect\u201d\n(03:10:16) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer",

We discuss female hormones, nutrition, supplementation, reproductive health, and fertility, including how the timing and duration of puberty impact a woman\u2019s long-term hormone cycles and menopause. We also discuss the pros and cons of various birth control methods and how hormonal vs. non-hormonal birth control each affects fertility. We cover the factors that impact egg and sperm quality and how to leverage timing for conception. We also discuss procedures to assess female fertility, including egg count and hormone testing, the process of egg freezing, in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other reproductive options. This episode represents fairly comprehensive coverage of female hormones and reproductive health, highlighting important tests and screening, behavioral, nutritional, supplement and prescription-based tools that women of any age can use to improve their fertility, hormone function and overall health.\u00a0\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Natalie Crawford\n(00:01:52) Sponsors: LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:04:59) Female Puberty & Growth Characteristics, Height\n(00:13:27) Eggs & Ovulation, Harvesting Eggs, In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)\n(00:17:31) Endocrine Disruptors, Fetal Development\n(00:21:39) Lavender, Tea Tree & Evening Primrose Oils, Scents, Diapers\n(00:25:13) Breast Milk vs. Formula & Fertility\n(00:26:04) Menstruation Cycle & Hormones, Timing\n(00:33:47) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:35:59) Estrogen, Progesterone & Menstrual Cycle\n(00:38:08) Hormonal Birth Control & Ovarian Reserve, AMH Testing, Fertility\n(00:42:42) Spermatogenesis & Testosterone; Heat: Ovaries vs Testes\n(00:46:11) Period & Pregnancy, Conception Window\n(00:48:56) Estrogen, Libido & Ovulation; Mittelschmerz\n(00:51:33) Tool: Intercourse Timing & Conception; Artificial Insemination, IVF\n(00:55:03) Egg/Sperm Quality, Cigarettes, Vaping, Cannabis & Alcohol\u00a0\n(01:03:29) Intrauterine Device (IUD), Depo-Provera & Fertility\n(01:10:00) Birth Control Risks & Benefits, Cancers, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)\n(01:19:39) Blood Clotting & Birth Control Pill; Health Screening\u00a0\n(01:24:50) Tool: AMH Testing, Ovarian Reserve, Antral Follicle Count Ultrasound\n(01:29:55) IVF, In Vitro Maturation (IVM); Early Ovarian Reserve Screening\n(01:35:40) Tools: Egg Freezing, IVF; Age & Egg Quality\n(01:43:37) Egg Freezing & IVF Procedures, Maternal Age, Success Rates\n(01:51:30) Tool: Sperm Freezing & Paternal Age, Vasectomy\n(01:55:01) Hormones, Egg Freezing & IVF\n(02:00:42) Three-Parent IVF, Mitochondrial DNA\n(02:05:21) IVF Embryo Storage & Donation; Donor Education & Consent\n(02:14:29) Autism, Developmental Disorders, IVF Babies, Age\u00a0\n(02:20:36) Tools: Sleep, Nutrition & Fertility; Dietary Fat\n(02:27:32) Protein, Meat, Tofu, Fish; Sugar, Artificial Sweeteners; Weight & Miscarriage\n(02:37:38) Tools: Supplements; Prenatal Vitamins, Omega 3s, Vitamin D, Coenzyme Q10\n(02:42:26) L-Carnitine & Male Fertility; PCOS & Myo-inositol; Metformin\n(02:47:11) Egg Retrieval, Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome, Minimal Stimulation\n(02:57:56) INVOcell\n(03:03:12) Egg Freezing, Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), Sperm Fragmentation\n(03:11:45) Genetic Testing, IVF Transfer & Success Rate, Embryo Banking\n(03:15:10) Menopause\n(03:19:47) Hormone Replacement Therapy & Menopause\n(03:22:25) Early-signs of Menopause\n(03:25:18) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer",

We cover the factors that impact egg and sperm quality and how to leverage timing for conception. We also discuss procedures to assess female fertility, including egg count and hormone testing, the process of egg freezing, in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other reproductive options. This episode represents fairly comprehensive coverage of female hormones and reproductive health, highlighting important tests and screening, behavioral, nutritional, supplement and prescription-based tools that women of any age can use to improve their fertility, hormone function and overall health.\u00a0</p><p>For show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit <a href=\"https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-natalie-crawford-female-hormone-health-fertility-vitality\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2><strong>Thank you to our sponsors</strong></h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href=\"https://go.hubermanlab.com/ag1BC\">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href=\"https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmntBC\">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href=\"https://go.hubermanlab.com/wakingupBC\">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href=\"https://go.hubermanlab.com/momentousBC\">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Natalie Crawford</p><p>(00:01:52) Sponsors: LMNT &amp; Waking Up</p><p>(00:04:59) Female Puberty &amp; Growth Characteristics, Height</p><p>(00:13:27) Eggs &amp; Ovulation, Harvesting Eggs, In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)</p><p>(00:17:31) Endocrine Disruptors, Fetal Development</p><p>(00:21:39) Lavender, Tea Tree &amp; Evening Primrose Oils, Scents, Diapers</p><p>(00:25:13) Breast Milk vs. Formula &amp; Fertility</p><p>(00:26:04) Menstruation Cycle &amp; Hormones, Timing</p><p>(00:33:47) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:35:59) Estrogen, Progesterone &amp; Menstrual Cycle</p><p>(00:38:08) Hormonal Birth Control &amp; Ovarian Reserve, AMH Testing, Fertility</p><p>(00:42:42) Spermatogenesis &amp; Testosterone; Heat: Ovaries vs Testes</p><p>(00:46:11) Period &amp; Pregnancy, Conception Window</p><p>(00:48:56) Estrogen, Libido &amp; Ovulation; Mittelschmerz</p><p>(00:51:33) Tool: Intercourse Timing &amp; Conception; Artificial Insemination, IVF</p><p>(00:55:03) Egg/Sperm Quality, Cigarettes, Vaping, Cannabis &amp; Alcohol\u00a0</p><p>(01:03:29) Intrauterine Device (IUD), Depo-Provera &amp; Fertility</p><p>(01:10:00) Birth Control Risks &amp; Benefits, Cancers, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)</p><p>(01:19:39) Blood Clotting &amp; Birth Control Pill; Health Screening\u00a0</p><p>(01:24:50) Tool: AMH Testing, Ovarian Reserve, Antral Follicle Count Ultrasound</p><p>(01:29:55) IVF, In Vitro Maturation (IVM); Early Ovarian Reserve Screening</p><p>(01:35:40) Tools: Egg Freezing, IVF; Age &amp; Egg Quality</p><p>(01:43:37) Egg Freezing &amp; IVF Procedures, Maternal Age, Success Rates</p><p>(01:51:30) Tool: Sperm Freezing &amp; Paternal Age, Vasectomy</p><p>(01:55:01) Hormones, Egg Freezing &amp; IVF</p><p>(02:00:42) Three-Parent IVF, Mitochondrial DNA</p><p>(02:05:21) IVF Embryo Storage &amp; Donation; Donor Education &amp; Consent</p><p>(02:14:29) Autism, Developmental Disorders, IVF Babies, Age\u00a0</p><p>(02:20:36) Tools: Sleep, Nutrition &amp; Fertility; Dietary Fat</p><p>(02:27:32) Protein, Meat, Tofu, Fish; Sugar, Artificial Sweeteners; Weight &amp; Miscarriage</p><p>(02:37:38) Tools: Supplements; Prenatal Vitamins, Omega 3s, Vitamin D, Coenzyme Q10</p><p>(02:42:26) L-Carnitine &amp; Male Fertility; PCOS &amp; Myo-inositol; Metformin</p><p>(02:47:11) Egg Retrieval, Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome, Minimal Stimulation</p><p>(02:57:56) INVOcell</p><p>(03:03:12) Egg Freezing, Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), Sperm Fragmentation</p><p>(03:11:45) Genetic Testing, IVF Transfer &amp; Success Rate, Embryo Banking</p><p>(03:15:10) Menopause</p><p>(03:19:47) Hormone Replacement Therapy &amp; Menopause</p><p>(03:22:25) Early-signs of Menopause</p><p>(03:25:18) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\">Disclaimer</a></p>\n      ",

            "content": "In this episode, I provide science-based tools and protocols to improve mood and mental health. These tools represent key takeaways from several recently published research studies, as well as from former Huberman Lab guests Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., an expert in the science of emotions, and Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist with vast clinical expertise in helping people overcome mental health challenges. I explain the first principles of self-care, which include the \u201cBig 6\u201d core pillars for mood and mental health. Those ensure our physiology is primed for our overall feelings of well-being.

He describes how the foundation of mental health is an understanding of one\u2019s own mind and the specific questions to ask in order to explore the conscious and unconscious parts of ourselves.

He also explains how unprocessed trauma can short-circuit the process and how to prevent that, and the role of friendships and other relational support systems in the journey of self-exploration for mental health.

            "content": "In this episode, I describe how your brain and body are fundamentally wired to perceive and respond to music and how those responses can be leveraged to improve your mood, allow for processing sad emotions and enhance learning and performance. I explain the data showing how music can increase motivation for cognitive or physical work, what specific music has been shown to enhance cognitive performance, and whether silence or music is more effective in enhancing focus while studying. I also discuss how specific musical pieces can rapidly reduce anxiety, as well as certain prescription medications. I explain how listening to certain types of music can improve various health metrics (e.g., heart rate). Finally, I discuss how music helps to enhance neuroplasticity (rewiring of brain connections), thereby improving learning and memory. Whether you sing, play an instrument or enjoy listening to music, this episode provides numerous science-informed tools for using music to enhance productivity, mood, emotional states, and overall enjoyment of life.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Music & Your Brain\n(00:03:32) The Brain Body Contract\n(00:03:49) Sponsors: LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:07:09) Music & Emotions; Brain & Body Interpretation\n(00:13:03) Music & Intent; Babies, Music & Movement\n(00:19:19) Tool: Health Metrics & Music, Breathing & Heart Rate\n(00:29:16) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:30:50) Music, Brain & Predictions\n(00:38:07) Music & Brain: Novelty, Arousal, Memories\n(00:44:22) Tool: Movement; Motivation & Faster Music\n(00:50:49) Tool: Cognitive Work & Binaural Beats\n(00:54:11) Silence or Music for Studying?, White Noise, Binaural Beats\n(00:58:47) Tool: Retain Information & Internal Dialogue\n(01:00:53) Tool: Focus, Work Breaks & Music\n(01:04:11) Physical Exercise, Performance & Music\n(01:08:43) Music & Shifting Mood\n(01:14:41) \u201cHappy\u201d vs. \u201cSad\u201d Music, \u201cOne-Hit Wonders\u201d & Artificial Intelligence\n(01:19:30) \u201cBass Face\u201d; Music, Movement & Facial Expressions\n(01:22:46) Tools: Shift to Happy Mood with Music; Sad Mood Catharsis\n(01:27:30) Tool: Music & Reducing Anxiety, \u201cWeightless\u201d\n(01:31:16) Playing Instruments, Singing & Brain Connectivity\n(01:39:58) Music & the Brain\n(01:42:14) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We also discuss our internal driving forces, how to align them and ultimately, how to cultivate a powerful \u201cgenerative drive\u201d of positive, aspirational pursuits.

The next episode in this special series explores how to build healthy relationships with others.\nFor the full show notes, including articles, books, and other resources, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1:\u00a0https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nEight Sleep:\u00a0https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nMomentous:\u00a0https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Improve Mental Health\n(00:02:19) Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up App\n(00:05:26) Structure & Function of Healthy Self\u00a0\n(00:16:25) Agency & Gratitude\n(00:21:14) Aggressive Drive, Pleasure Drive, Generative Drive\n(00:30:00) Physical & Mental Health Similarities, Verb States\n(00:37:05) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:38:32) Lack of Motivation, Drives\n(00:43:06) Video Games/Social Media & Distraction, Generative Drive\n(00:51:46) Asking Better Questions, Psychiatric Medicine, Physical Health Parallels\n(00:59:10) Sponsor: Eight Sleep\n(01:00:30) Self-Reflection & Structure of Self \u201cCupboards\u201d, Trauma & Agency\n(01:08:53) Feeling Stuck, Defense Mechanisms & Sublimation, Character\n(01:13:58) Self-Reflection & Function of Self \u201cCupboards\u201d, Self-Awareness\n(01:19:24) Defense Mechanisms & \u201cActing Out\u201d\n(01:26:43) Salience, Intrusive Thoughts\n(01:31:24) Self-Reflection, Behaviors & Strivings; Roadmap Forward\n(01:38:25) Internal Narratives, Childhood\n(01:44:44) Internal Narratives: Self-Scrutiny & Overcoming; Trauma\n(01:55:18) Time Required for Change, Understanding Intrusive Thoughts\n(02:03:13) Self-Reflection on Internal Drives; Envy\n(02:09:56) Generative Drive; Strong Aggressive Drive & Envy\n(02:21:50) High Aggressive Drive & Social Relationships, Narcissism\n(02:28:43) Narcissism, Destruction, Envy\n(02:37:18) Narcissism & Childhood, Change\n(02:41:26) Engaging with Narcissists, Disengagement\n(02:44:47) Demoralization, Learned Helplessness\n(02:49:34) Self-Inventory of Drives, Optimization\n(02:56:09) Social Media & Salience, Generative Drive\n(03:03:21) Rational Aspiration\n(03:13:16) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, over-thinking and how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate.

We discuss what it takes to be a true innovator, including the personality traits required, the role of environment and the support systems needed to bring revolutionary ideas to fruition. We discuss risk-taking as a necessary but potentially hazardous trait, as well as the role of intrinsic motivation and one\u2019s ability to navigate uncertainty. We also discuss artificial intelligence (AI) and Marc\u2019s stance that soon everyone will use AI as their personalized coach and guide for making decisions about their health, relationships, finances and more \u2014 all of which he believes will greatly enhance our quality of life. We also delve into nuclear power, gene editing, public trust, universities, politics, and AI regulation.

We also discuss the link between inflammation and depression. We also discuss Dr. Linden\u2019s terminal illness diagnosis, his mindset during chemotherapy and what his diagnosis has taught him about the mind, gratitude, time perception and life.

I discuss how ketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other psychiatric challenges.

We discuss how our identities develop and change, how our beliefs and internal narratives shape our perception of self, and how to use structured introspection about our values to determine our goals. We discuss how to cope and grow through uncertain situations, especially those that force us to reexamine our roles and identity.

I also discuss how our internal narratives drive our ability to make progress. I contrast the growth mindset vs. the fixed mindset and describe how the type of feedback or praise we receive shapes our mindsets, and the huge advantage of rewarding and celebrating \u201cverbs\u201d (actions) rather than adjectives (performance labels). I also discuss data showing how stress can enhance performance and explain why the growth mindset works synergistically with the \u201cstress-is-enhancing mindset,\u201d and how to combine them. Whether you are a student, coach, therapist, parent, teacher or simply someone seeking to improve at something, this episode provides numerous science-supported tools for how to adopt a performance enhancing mindset.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Growth Mindset\n(00:03:11) Sponsors: LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:05:17) Mindset & Narrative\n(00:12:58) Intelligence Feedback vs. Effort Feedback, Identity Labels\n(00:20:10) Intelligence vs. Effort Praise: Performance, Persistence & Self-Representation\n(00:26:45) Fixed Intelligence vs. Growth Mindset\n(00:28:53) Tool: Intelligence (Performance) vs. Effort Narrative, Labels\n(00:32:30) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:34:36) Tool: Failure & Identity; Effort & Verbs\n(00:35:41) Tool: Timing, Intelligence vs. Effort Praise & Performance\n(00:40:080 Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset: Failure & Performance\n(00:50:28) Tool: Shift from Fixed Mindset\n(00:54:23) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(00:55:30) Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset\n(01:05:53) How Stress Can Enhance Performance\u00a0\n(01:13:21) Growth Mindset + Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset & Performance\n(01:20:36) Reframing Stress\n(01:25:45) Tool 1: Student & Teacher Mindset\n(01:28:17) Tool 2: Effort Praise/Feedback: Verbs not Labels\n(01:31:24) Tool 3: Errors & Seeking Help\n(01:32:58) Tool 4: Self-Teaching & Growth Mindset\n(01:34:35) Tool 5: Reframe \u201cMind is Like a Muscle\u201d Analogy\n(01:39:20) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

We discuss Tim\u2019s process of exploration, experimentation and mastery \u2014 themes that have spanned his career that have placed him on the cutting-edge of many important fields. Tim explains what questions to ask when approaching any new endeavor in order to maximize success. He also explains how to incorporate structure and playfulness into skill and knowledge mastery, how to find and work with mentors, the key importance of location and networks in creating truly impactful things. We also discuss Tim\u2019s philanthropic efforts to support research on psychedelics for the treatment of mental health challenges and we discuss his latest creative endeavors.

This should be of interest to those curious about MDMA, neuropharmacology, the origins of emotional processing in the brain, empathy, PTSD, neuroplasticity, mental health and psychiatry.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) MDMA \u201cEcstasy\u201d\n(00:04:54) Sponsors: LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:08:18) MDMA History & Synthesis; Legality\n(00:14:45) MDMA, Methamphetamine (Meth), Dopamine & Serotonin\n(00:23:30) MDMA vs Psychedelics vs Ketamine\n(00:26:54) MDMA & Serotonin 1B Receptor, Subjective Feelings, Trauma\n(00:30:12) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:34:51) Amygdala & Threat Detection, Pro-Social Behavior, MDMA Dosages\n(00:45:48) Interoception, MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n(00:52:36) Long-Term Effects, Threat Detection & PTSD\n(00:56:14) MDMA, Social Connection & Empathy; Meth, SSRIs\n(01:07:22) Oxytocin & MDMA\n(01:16:10) Safety & Neurotoxicity; Recreational Use, Caffeine & Fentanyl\n(01:26:36) Is MDMA Neurotoxic?; Poly-Pharmacology, Body Temperature\n(01:37:07) Post-MDMA \u201cCrash\u201d, Prolactin & P\u20115\u2011P\n(01:43:07) PTSD & Trauma; Talk Therapy, SSRIs\n(01:54:09) PTSD Treatment: Talk Therapy + MDMA\n(02:02:46) MDMA & Addiction; Dissociative PTSD & Empathy\n(02:09:47) Side-Effects?, MDMA Efficacy & Legality\n(02:15:22) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

                "summary": "In this episode, I discuss what psilocybin is (chemically) and how it works at the cellular and neural circuit level to trigger neuroplasticity, which is our brain\u2019s ability to rewire itself in ways that lead to long-lasting shifts in our emotional, cognitive and behavioral patterns and abilities. I discuss the emerging clinical trial evidence for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, addictions and other psychiatric challenges. I explain the typical duration and phases of a psilocybin journey, the different categories of dosages often used and I explain the importance of set, setting and support when using psychedelics. I explain which groups of people place themselves at great risk by taking psilocybin as well as groups that could benefit, and I highlight the rapidly changing legal and medical landscape around psilocybin. This episode is a thorough exploration of psilocybin from the scientific and clinical literature perspective and ought to be of interest to anyone curious about psilocybin, mental health, neuroplasticity and/or psychedelics more generally.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Psilocybin, Legal Considerations\n(00:08:48) Sponsors: LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:12:00) Psilocybin Becomes Psilocin in the Gut, Serotonin\n(00:17:00) The Serotonin 2A Receptor, Therapeutic Outcomes SSRIs vs. Psilocybin\n(00:21:40) Serotonin Receptor Expression; Visual Hallucinations & Eyes Closed\n(00:26:02) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:27:21) Safety & Cautions for Specific Patient Populations\n(00:30:28) Psilocybin, \u201cMagic Mushrooms\u201d Dosing, Micro-Dosing, \u201cHeroic Doses\u201d\n(00:36:21) Psychedelic Journey: Set, Setting & Support\n(00:43:43) Music & the Psilocybin Journey; Duration of Effects\n(00:48:58) Psilocybin & the Brain: Subjective Experiences, Perception\n(00:59:48) Brain Networks & Therapeutic Outcomes\n(01:05:23) Creativity; Music, Emotionality & Psychedelic Journeys\n(01:12:39) Depression & Psychedelics as Neuroplasticity \u201cWedge\u201d\n(01:16:53) Positive Psychedelic Journeys, Unity, \u201cOceanic Boundlessness\u201d\n(01:25:23) \u201cBad Trips\u201d, Anxiety & Physiological Sighs\n(01:32:57) Therapeutic Use of Psilocybin\n(01:36:11) Neuroplasticity, Structural Brain Changes & Psilocybin\n(01:48:08) Psychedelics: Therapeutic Breakthroughs & Depression\n(01:56:37) Combining Psilocybin Therapy & Talk Therapy, Antidepressant Effects\n(02:03:11) Psilocybin Experience & Mental Health\n(2:06:42) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel \u2014 which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\nSubscribe to Huberman Lab Premium at https://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:01:53) What Are the Best Eye Exercises, Supplements, Food, Protection Practices for the Eye?\n(00:33:55) Huberman Lab Premium\n\nIn the full AMA episode, we discuss:\n\nWhy We Yawn and Don't Yawn During Sleep\n\nHow to Stay Motivated and Overcome Lethargy in Learning\n\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

I discuss neuroplasticity-based skill development and the roles of focus, sleep, movement restriction, and agitation. I then present five key principles of mental visualization to enhance learning speed, accuracy, and consistency. I also provide examples of specific protocols, including repetitions, rest periods, and session frequency, and how to adapt these methods for injuries or breaks from traditional training. Throughout, I reference the scientific studies supporting these concepts.

He also discusses Neuralink\u2019s efforts to create novel brain-machine interfaces (BMI) that enhance human learning, cognition and communication as a means to accelerate human progress. Dr. MacDougall also explains other uses of bio-integrated machines in daily life; for instance, he implanted himself with a radio chip into his hand that allows him to open specific doors, collect and store data and communicate with machines and other objects in unique ways.

Dr. MacDougall trained at the University of California, San Diego and Stanford University School of Medicine and is a world expert in brain stimulation, repair and augmentation. He explains Neuralink\u2019s mission and projects to develop and use neural implant technologies and robotics to 1) restore normal movement to paralyzed patients and those with neurodegeneration-based movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s Disease) and to repair malfunctions of deep brain circuitry (e.g., those involved in addiction).

Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair \u201cdead\u201d (bald) zones. For many listeners, thinning, brittle hair, or pattern baldness are a source of anxiety and stress.

Dopamine is an incredibly powerful neuromodulator involved in basic functions (e.g., hunger, romantic attraction, etc.) and feats of cognitive and physical performance; by understanding the dynamics of dopamine, listeners ought to be better positioned to overcome procrastination, maintain motivation, and improve confidence.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dopamine\n(00:02:48) Sponsors: LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:06:27) Dopamine Brain Circuits\n(00:14:53) Goals & Addiction\n(00:17:13) Dopamine Dynamics, \u201cWave Pool\u201d analogy\n(00:20:28) Craving, Motivation, Pursuit & Reward Prediction Error\n(00:24:46) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:29:40) Feedback Cues & Reward Contingent Learning, \u201cScoreboard\u201d\n(00:37:40) Addiction; Pleasure & Pain Imbalance\n(00:44:55) Dopamine Release & Addictive Substances/Behaviors\n(00:50:43) Addiction Recovery, Binding Behaviors\n(00:53:25) Tools: Maintain Baseline Dopamine Levels\n(01:03:26) Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine\n(01:09:38) Prescriptions & Supplementation: L-Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens\n(01:18:58) Dopamine Trough Recovery, Postpartum Depression\n(01:23:31) Dopamine Dynamics, \u201cDopamine Stacking\u201d; Intrinsic Motivation\n(01:38:10) Making Effort the Reward, Growth Mindset\n(01:41:49) Tool: Overcome Procrastination\n(01:52:16) Tool: Meditation & Procrastination\n(01:57:01) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Dr. Panda explains how TRE, and also longer fasts, can positively impact obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, age-related chronic diseases, and improve mood and cognitive performance. He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that ~50% of all people engage in, negatively impacts their health and explains how specific simple adjustments to these can positively shift their subjective feelings of health and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism. We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include our patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health and how by simply confining our calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window, can positively impact our physical health, mental health and longevity.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Satchin Panda\n(00:03:18) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:07:24) Time-Restricted Eating (TRE), Calorie Restriction (CR) & Health\n(00:14:38) Mealtimes & Circadian Clock\n(00:21:34) Circadian Rhythm, Meal Anticipation, Digestion\n(00:25:28) Breaking a Fast, Burning Fat\n(00:28:45) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:34:04) CR, Time Restricted Eating, Circadian Rhythm & Longevity\n(00:47:20) Gender, Hormones & CR; Relative Energy Deficient in Sports (REDS)\n(00:52:40) Physical Activity, Nutrition & Feeding Window\n(00:59:04) Nutrition Timing, Quality & Quantity; Low- Carbohydrate Diet\n(01:03:00) Caffeine, Nighttime Socialization, Fire, Breakfast\n(01:16:20) Circadian Rhythm, \u201cNight Owls\u201d & Genetics\n(01:26:37) Morning vs. Nighttime Discussions, \u201cMe Time\u201d\n(01:30:08) Light Sensitivity & \u201cNight Owls\u201d; Puberty, Melatonin\n(01:36:05) Shift Workers, Health & Disease\n(01:45:43) Artificial Lights, Young Adults & Sleep, Metabolic Dysfunction\n(01:50:59) Firefighters, Sleep & TRE; Cardiovascular Health, Blood Glucose\n(02:05:18) Shift Workers & Sleep; Alcohol & Caffeine\n(02:09:15) 12- Hour Feeding Window for Adults & Children, Sleep\n(02:22:10) Meal Timing\n(02:25:20) \u201cComplete Fast\u201d, Longer Fasts, Physical Health & Mental Health\n(02:28:12) \u201cFat Fasting\u201d, Blood Glucose & Insulin\n(02:31:57) Fasting, Metformin, Rapamycin & Longevity; Human Applicability?\n(02:39:14) Circadian Rhythm & Metabolism\n(02:41:36) Ontime Health App, Circadian Clock App\n(02:46:17) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

                "summary": "In this episode, my guest is Satchin Panda, PhD, professor and the director of the Regulatory Biology Laboratories at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. We discuss his lab\u2019s discovery that \u201ctime-restricted eating\u201d (TRE) aka intermittent fasting, is beneficial effects for metabolic health and longevity. Dr. Panda explains how TRE, and also longer fasts, can positively impact obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, age-related chronic diseases, and improve mood and cognitive performance. He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that ~50% of all people engage in, negatively impacts their health and explains how specific simple adjustments to these can positively shift their subjective feelings of health and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism. We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include our patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health and how by simply confining our calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window, can positively impact our physical health, mental health and longevity.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Satchin Panda\n(00:03:18) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:07:24) Time-Restricted Eating (TRE), Calorie Restriction (CR) & Health\n(00:14:38) Mealtimes & Circadian Clock\n(00:21:34) Circadian Rhythm, Meal Anticipation, Digestion\n(00:25:28) Breaking a Fast, Burning Fat\n(00:28:45) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:34:04) CR, Time Restricted Eating, Circadian Rhythm & Longevity\n(00:47:20) Gender, Hormones & CR; Relative Energy Deficient in Sports (REDS)\n(00:52:40) Physical Activity, Nutrition & Feeding Window\n(00:59:04) Nutrition Timing, Quality & Quantity; Low- Carbohydrate Diet\n(01:03:00) Caffeine, Nighttime Socialization, Fire, Breakfast\n(01:16:20) Circadian Rhythm, \u201cNight Owls\u201d & Genetics\n(01:26:37) Morning vs. Nighttime Discussions, \u201cMe Time\u201d\n(01:30:08) Light Sensitivity & \u201cNight Owls\u201d; Puberty, Melatonin\n(01:36:05) Shift Workers, Health & Disease\n(01:45:43) Artificial Lights, Young Adults & Sleep, Metabolic Dysfunction\n(01:50:59) Firefighters, Sleep & TRE; Cardiovascular Health, Blood Glucose\n(02:05:18) Shift Workers & Sleep; Alcohol & Caffeine\n(02:09:15) 12- Hour Feeding Window for Adults & Children, Sleep\n(02:22:10) Meal Timing\n(02:25:20) \u201cComplete Fast\u201d, Longer Fasts, Physical Health & Mental Health\n(02:28:12) \u201cFat Fasting\u201d, Blood Glucose & Insulin\n(02:31:57) Fasting, Metformin, Rapamycin & Longevity; Human Applicability?\n(02:39:14) Circadian Rhythm & Metabolism\n(02:41:36) Ontime Health App, Circadian Clock App\n(02:46:17) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

Dr. Galpin describes proper hydration for before and during exercise, how dehydration and/or low electrolyte concentrations impede physical and mental performance. He discusses what supplements work best for fitness and performance, how to decide which to take, if any, and when to take them. He also shares high-impact, lower-cost supplements and nutrition recommendations to benefit performance, recovery, and sleep. This episode also includes an audience Q&A.

He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. We cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance.

When most people hear about \u201csupplements,\u201d they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can\u2019t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss \u201cfoundational\u201d supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively.

                "summary": "In this episode, I explain how to design a supplementation protocol to support maximum mental and physical health and performance depending on your specific needs, nutrition, lifestyle and finances. When most people hear about \u201csupplements,\u201d they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can\u2019t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss \u201cfoundational\u201d supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively. This episode will explain how to design the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol to meet your particular goals and support your overall health, including vitality and longevity.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1:\u00a0https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT:\u00a0https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Supplements\n(00:03:38) Hierarchy of Tools/Interventions, Developing a Supplementation Protocol\n(00:12:09) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:15:38) Role of Supplements, Foundational Supplements, Water/Fat-Soluble Vitamins\n(00:21:07) Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule\n(00:25:25) Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens\n(00:28:04) Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition\n(00:32:09) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:33:06) Supplements for Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog\n(00:36:44) Adaptogens & Broad-Spectrum Foundational Supplements\n(00:38:35) Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs\n(00:43:45) Supplements to Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine\n(00:50:52) Supplements for Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin\n(00:55:55) Melatonin Caution\n(00:58:11) Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects\n(01:03:53) Nutrition & Behavior for Hormone Health\n(01:08:59) Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root\u00a0\n(01:12:48) Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions\u00a0\n(01:16:04) Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork\u00a0\n(01:23:06) Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido\u00a0\n(01:27:24) Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility\n(01:30:54) Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine\u00a0\n(01:36:57) Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine\n(01:38:55) Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements\n(01:43:58) Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n(01:47:25) Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein\u00a0\n(01:50:09) Kids, Aging & Supplements\n(01:55:25) A Rational Supplementation Protocol\n(01:58:36) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac"

He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the \"Making Sense\" podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding \u201cthe self\u201d and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one\u2019s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (\u201cchatter\u201d) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam\u2019s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Sam Harris\u00a0\n(00:04:54) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:08:54) Sense of Self & Meditation, Dualism of Self\n(00:18:07) Sense of Self in Brain & Body\u00a0\n(00:25:28) Consciousness vs. Contents, Meditation\n(00:28:25) Interrupting Sense of Self & Attentional Focus, Visual Saccade\u00a0\n(00:33:30) Observer & Actor, Default Mode Network & Meditation, Blind Spot\n(00:36:52) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:41:57) Mediation & Paths to Understanding Consciousness, Non-Dualistic Experience\n(00:57:32) Sense of Self throughout Evolution\u00a0\n(01:07:40) Sense of Self from Human Development, Language\n(01:19:46) Internal Dialogue, Distractibility & Mindfulness\u00a0\n(01:26:27) Time Perception & Mindfulness, Vipassana Meditation, Resistance & Pain\n(01:37:13) Consciousness & Sense of Control, Free Will\n(01:43:14) Authoring Thoughts: Storytelling & Ideas, Free Will\n(01:52:11) Meditation & the Paradoxical Search for Self\n(02:06:44) Meditation & Concentration Practice\u00a0\n(02:11:58) Mindfulness, \u201cSkylike Mind\u201d & Thoughts\n(02:15:11) States of Self & Context, Dualistic Experiences\n(02:32:39) Distraction & Identification of Thoughts, Meditation & \u201cFlow\u201d States\n(02:42:58) Eyes-Open Meditations, Sense of Self, Visual Cues & Social Interactions\n(02:54:59) Paths to Meditation, Mindfulness Meditation Step-Functions\n(03:05:58) Psychedelics, MDMA & Experiences in Consciousness, Religion\n(03:21:11) Meditation, Psychedelic Journeys & Inner Truths\n(03:29:48) Psilocybin, Ego-Dissolution & Thought Expansion\n(03:40:09) Process vs. Achievement of Goals, Fulfillment in Present\n(03:54:29) Leaving Twitter; Conflict, Life Interruption & Politics\u00a0\n(04:06:14) Social Media, Attentional Disruption & Deep Work\n(04:15:39) Meditation & Sense of Self\n(04:19:02) Sam Harris & Waking Up App, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac",

This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Sam Harris\u00a0\n(00:04:54) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:08:54) Sense of Self & Meditation, Dualism of Self\n(00:18:07) Sense of Self in Brain & Body\u00a0\n(00:25:28) Consciousness vs. Contents, Meditation\n(00:28:25) Interrupting Sense of Self & Attentional Focus, Visual Saccade\u00a0\n(00:33:30) Observer & Actor, Default Mode Network & Meditation, Blind Spot\n(00:36:52) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:41:57) Mediation & Paths to Understanding Consciousness, Non-Dualistic Experience\n(00:57:32) Sense of Self throughout Evolution\u00a0\n(01:07:40) Sense of Self from Human Development, Language\n(01:19:46) Internal Dialogue, Distractibility & Mindfulness\u00a0\n(01:26:27) Time Perception & Mindfulness, Vipassana Meditation, Resistance & Pain\n(01:37:13) Consciousness & Sense of Control, Free Will\n(01:43:14) Authoring Thoughts: Storytelling & Ideas, Free Will\n(01:52:11) Meditation & the Paradoxical Search for Self\n(02:06:44) Meditation & Concentration Practice\u00a0\n(02:11:58) Mindfulness, \u201cSkylike Mind\u201d & Thoughts\n(02:15:11) States of Self & Context, Dualistic Experiences\n(02:32:39) Distraction & Identification of Thoughts, Meditation & \u201cFlow\u201d States\n(02:42:58) Eyes-Open Meditations, Sense of Self, Visual Cues & Social Interactions\n(02:54:59) Paths to Meditation, Mindfulness Meditation Step-Functions\n(03:05:58) Psychedelics, MDMA & Experiences in Consciousness, Religion\n(03:21:11) Meditation, Psychedelic Journeys & Inner Truths\n(03:29:48) Psilocybin, Ego-Dissolution & Thought Expansion\n(03:40:09) Process vs. Achievement of Goals, Fulfillment in Present\n(03:54:29) Leaving Twitter; Conflict, Life Interruption & Politics\u00a0\n(04:06:14) Social Media, Attentional Disruption & Deep Work\n(04:15:39) Meditation & Sense of Self\n(04:19:02) Sam Harris & Waking Up App, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac"

            "content": "In this episode, I explain how the brain engages in creative thinking and, based on that mechanistic understanding, the tools to improve one\u2019s ability to think creatively and innovate in any area. I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation & non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability. Excitingly, creativity is a skill that can be cultivated and enhanced; this episode outlines many tools to help anyone access creativity and apply creative patterns of thought to different domains of life.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Creativity\n(00:04:47) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT, Waking Up\n(00:08:51) What is Creativity?\n(00:11:16) Creativity in Visual Arts, Escher & Banksy\n(00:23:37) Neural Circuits of Creativity\n(00:27:54) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:33:13) Creative Ideas & Divergent Thinking\n(00:42:09) Testing Creative Ideas & Convergent Thinking\n(00:46:41) Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways\n(00:58:06) Tool: Open Monitoring Meditation & Divergent Thinking\n(01:07:38) Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking\n(01:11:06) Mood, Creativity & Dopamine\n(01:16:00) Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine\n(01:23:41) Dopamine Supplementation; L-Tyrosine, Caffeine\n(01:30:15) Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest, Mesocortical Dopamine & Divergent Thinking\n(01:43:13) Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking\n(01:49:13) Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis\n(01:52:04) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Creativity\n(01:54:45) Tool: Movement & Divergent Thinking\n(02:01:02) Tool: Narratives & Storytelling for Creativity\n(02:14:47) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac",

            "content": "My guest is Kyle Gillett, MD, a dual board-certified physician in family medicine and obesity medicine and an expert in optimizing hormone levels to improve overall health. We discuss how to optimize male hormones using a range of nutritional and behavioral tools, exercise, and supplementation (including discussions on tongkat ali,\u00a0fadogia agrestis, creatine, peptides and more).

Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\nSubscribe to Huberman Lab Premium at https://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:00:54) Are there any science-backed protocols to increase deep sleep?\n(00:28:11) Huberman Lab Premium\nIn the full 1.5 hour AMA episode, we discuss:\n\nWhat is your studying routine?\n\nWhat's the ideal amount of protein intake?\n\nAny tips to eliminate sugar cravings?\n\nWhat can we do when we wake up early in the morning before the sun is up and can\u2019t benefit from direct sunlight exposure?\n\nIs it better to do shorter bouts of dynamic stretching more frequently throughout the day or longer bouts but multiple times per week?\n\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I explain how caffeine powerfully reinforces the consumption of certain foods and drinks\u2014thereby increasing how much we like their tastes and seek them out. I discuss the mechanisms by which caffeine increases focus, alertness and mood and reduces sleepiness. I also explain many practical tools for caffeine use, including delaying caffeine intake after waking, intermittent caffeine use, during fasting, before and during exercise, and the use of theanine to curb jitters caused by caffeine.

He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility.

He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs.

We discuss the science of energy utilization and balance, the efficacy of different diets (e.g., ketogenic, vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore), and how best to build lean muscle mass and lose fat. We also discuss optimal protein and fiber intake, the best sources of protein, the correlation between appetite, satiety signals and exercise, along with male and female-specific needs. Dr. Norton also explains how to support a healthy gut microbiome and offers insight into sugar and artificial sweeteners, processed, cooked, and raw foods, supplements, seed oils, and the relationship of LDL/HDL levels to cardiovascular health.

We discuss the science of energy utilization and balance, the efficacy of different diets (e.g., ketogenic, vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore), and how best to build lean muscle mass and lose fat. We also discuss optimal protein and fiber intake, the best sources of protein, the correlation between appetite, satiety signals and exercise, along with male and female-specific needs. Dr. Norton also explains how to support a healthy gut microbiome and offers insight into sugar and artificial sweeteners, processed, cooked, and raw foods, supplements, seed oils, and the relationship of LDL/HDL levels to cardiovascular health. This episode serves as a master class in nutrition, metabolism and exercise and is sure to benefit people of all ages and with different health and fitness goals.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Layne Norton, Nutrition & Fitness\n(00:03:10) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:06:50) Calories & Cellular Energy Production\n(00:12:35) Energy Balance, Food Labels, Fiber\n(00:15:19) Resting Metabolic Rate, Thermic Effect of Food\n(00:19:04) Exercise & Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)\n(00:25:49) Losing Weight, Tracking Calories, Daily Weighing\n(00:29:24) Post-Exercise Metabolic Rate, Appetite\n(00:34:35) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:36:19) Exercise & Appetite, Calorie Trackers, Placebo Effects & Beliefs\n(00:43:46) Exercise & Satiety Signals, Maintain Weight Loss & Identity\n(00:56:32) Weight Loss & Maintenance, Diet Adherence\n(01:03:33) Restrictive Diets & Transition Periods\n(01:08:03) Gut Health & Appetite\n(01:16:23) Tool: Supporting Gut Health, Fiber & Longevity\n(01:23:59) LDL, HDL & Cardiovascular Disease\n(01:30:31) Leucine, mTOR & Protein Synthesis\n(01:37:31) Tool: Daily Protein Intake & Muscle Mass\n(01:44:24) Protein & Fasting, Lean Body Mass\n(01:55:38) Plant-Based Proteins: Whey, Soy, Leucine, Corn, Pea\n(02:04:28) Processed Foods\n(02:11:54) Obesity Epidemic, Calorie Intake & Energy Output\n(02:17:33) Obesity, Sugar & Fiber, Restriction & Craving\n(02:25:57) Artificial Sweeteners & Blood Sugar\n(02:38:55) Artificial Sweeteners & Gut Microbiome, Sucralose, Blood Sugar\n(02:50:19) Rapid Weight Loss, Satiety & Beliefs\n(02:58:13) Seed Oils & Obesity, Saturated Fat, Overall Energy Toxicity\n(03:08:15) Females, Diet, Exercise & Menstrual Cycles\n(03:14:05) Raw vs. Cooked Foods\n(03:16:32) Berberine & Glucose Scavenging\n(03:19:12) Fiber & Gastric Emptying Time\n(03:21:00) Supplements, Creatine Monohydrate, Rhodiola Rosea\n(03:30:33) Hard Training; Challenge & Mental Resilience\n(03:36:12) Carbon App\n(03:47:11) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level.\u00a0I also explain the concept behind the \u201cthird-eye center,\u201d what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability.

            "content": "I describe a fitness protocol that maximizes all the major sought-after aspects of physical fitness, including strength, endurance and flexibility. I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery.

He is also the Director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications for brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first discuss the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We discuss Dr. Williams\u2019 work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to depression, trauma, PTSD, and other mood disorders. We then dive deep into the history, biology, modern use, and safety margins of the various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise, and training to control the brain-heart-rate pathways. Regardless of age, all those interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams\u2019 knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Nolan Williams, Brain Stimulation & Depression Treatment\n(00:03:48) Sponsors: LMNT\n(00:09:16) Depression, Risk Factors, Emergency Psychiatric Treatments\n(00:15:11) The Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex\n(00:17:51) Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome\n(00:22:34) Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)\n(00:33:02) Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS\n(00:35:30) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:39:00) Belief/Identity \u201cRules\u201d, Re-scripting, TMS & Talk Therapy\n(00:45:49) Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment\n(00:48:36) Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia\n(00:54:27) Ketamine, the Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience or Biology?\n(01:03:42) SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance or Circuit?\n(01:13:58) Memories & \u201cRule\u201d Creation; Psilocybin & \u201cRule\u201d Resolution\n(01:21:00) MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin & Depression Treatment\n(01:24:12) Is MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin\n(01:30:38) Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment\n(01:34:53) Exposure Response Prevention: \u201cLetting Go\u201d & Depression Treatment\n(01:41:23) Normal Spectrums for Mental Health Disorders\n(01:45:35) Ibogaine & \u201cLife Review\u201d; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials\n(01:57:16) Clinical Use of Psychedelics\n(02:01:59) Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study\n(02:06:55) Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses\n(02:14:52) Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol\n(02:20:42) Circadian Reset for Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light\n(02:28:43) Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study\n(02:34:25) Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation\n(02:45:35) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

                "summary": "In this episode, I discuss cannabis (aka marijuana), including the biological mechanisms underlying its effects on the mind and body, its known medical applications, its impact on libido, creativity, hunger, hormones and more. I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and one\u2019s propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Cannabis (Marijuana)\n(00:005:02) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:07:03) Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Sleep & Anxiety\n(00:15:08) Cannabis Strains, Psychoactive Compounds: THC & CBD\n(00:19:34) Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects\n(00:25:55) Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains\n(00:31:56) Naturally Occurring Receptors: Nicotinic & Cannabinoid Receptors (CB1)\n(00:35:18) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:40:35) THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence\n(00:43:14) Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System Function\n(00:53:07) Biological Effects of Cannabis\n(00:56:29) Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia\n(01:04:58) Cannabis Indica & Subjective Effects, Memory, Dosage\n(01:09:41) Brain Areas Affected by THC & CBD, Side Effects\n(01:16:08) Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine\n(01:26:41) Does Cannabis Increase Creativity?\n(01:35:08) Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes in Speech Patterns\n(01:46:46) Cannabis & Libido, Dopamine & Prolactin\n(01:56:55) Cannabis & Hormones: Prolactin, Testosterone, Estrogen & Fertility\n(02:06:53) Smoking/Vaping Tobacco or Cannabis & Negative Health Consequences\n(02:10:06) Avoiding Cannabis During Pregnancy/Breastfeeding, Fetal Neural Development\n(02:18:13) Negative Health Consequences of Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance\n(02:25:57) Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition to Psychosis\n(02:34:36) Adolescent Cannabis Use: Brain Development & Mental Health Disorders\n(02:41:44) Cannabis & Pain Management, Divergent Effects of Cannabis\n(02:44:54) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn\n\u00a0Title Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

Dr. Anderson is a Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). We discuss how states of mind (and body) arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience, and hormones, and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior. We also discuss peptides\u00a0and their role in social isolation-induced anxiety and aggression. Dr. Anderson also describes novel, potentially powerful therapeutics for mental health.

Dr. Anderson is a Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). We discuss how states of mind (and body) arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience, and hormones, and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior.

I explain science-supported strategies for transitioning into focus, maintaining focus during the work bout, and exiting the focus session, which is also critical, including decompression/defocusing tools. I explain when and how to use: binaural beats, caffeine, deliberate cold exposure, the pros and cons of working in fasted vs. fed states, and supplements and foods that enhance dopamine, epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) and acetylcholine to promote optimal focus. Also, I explain how short behavioral practices, such as meditation and visual gaze training, will benefit your ability to focus over the long term. As deep focus is crucial to significantly improve cognitive or physical performance in any realm, this episode should be useful to anyone.

Also, I explain how short behavioral practices, such as meditation and visual gaze training, will benefit your ability to focus over the long term. As deep focus is crucial to significantly improve cognitive or physical performance in any realm, this episode should be useful to anyone. By the end, you\u2019ll have an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost focus and concentration strategies to select from that can be tailored to your physical and mental performance needs.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Focus Toolkit\u00a0\n(00:04:42) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:09:37) The \u201cArrow Model\u201d of Focus: Epinephrine, Acetylcholine & Dopamine\n(00:15:15) Modulation vs. Mediation, Importance of Sleep\n(00:18:11) Tool: Binaural Beats to Improve Concentration\u00a0\n(00:20:54) Tool: White, Brown & Pink Noise, Transition to Focused State\n(00:22:55) Warm-Up for Cognitive Work, Refocusing Attention & Neuroplasticity\u00a0\n(00:26:14) Tool: Ultradian Cycles: Warm-Up, Maintaining Focus & Deliberate Defocusing\u00a0\n(00:31:22) How Many Daily Ultradian Cycles Can One Perform?\u00a0\n(00:32:28) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:35:35) Virtusan: Mental & Physical Health Journeys\u00a0\n(00:36:52) Tool: Fasted vs. Fed States & Focus, Prevent an Afternoon Crash, Ketosis\n(00:45:52) Tool: Foods to Improve Focus & Regulating Food Volume\n(00:47:53) Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness\n(00:52:55) Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration\u00a0\n(00:55:46) Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine\u00a0\n(01:00:39) Layer Focusing Tools & Design Your Own Protocols\u00a0\n(01:01:19) Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability to Refocus\u00a0\n(01:07:40) Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods\n(01:12:13) Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States\n(01:16:07) Optimal Time of Day to Use Specific Tools\n(01:16:46) Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze\u00a0\n(01:20:42) Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work\u00a0\n(01:24:43) Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids\u00a0\n(01:27:28) Tool: Creatine Monohydrate\u00a0\n(01:29:10) Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk of Stroke? & Garlic\u00a0\n(01:33:52) Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food\n(01:34:47) Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability\u00a0\n(01:36:50) ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced Dosage\n(01:39:19) Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency\u00a0\n(01:42:56) Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine\n(01:44:50) Tool: Other Supplements to Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine\u00a0\n(01:46:46) Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools for Focus\n(01:49:12) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

We also discuss the connections between language, singing and dance and why song may have evolved before language.

Dr. Jarvis\u2019 research spans the molecular and genetic mechanisms of vocal communication, comparative genomics of speech and language across species and the relationship between speech, language and movement. We discuss the unique ability of humans (and certain animal species) to learn and communicate using complex language, including verbal speech production and the ability to interpret both written and spoken language. We also discuss the connections between language, singing and dance and why song may have evolved before language. Dr. Jarvis also explains some of the underlying biological and genetic components of stutter/speech disorders, non-verbal communication, why it's easiest to learn a language as a child and how individuals can learn multiple languages at any age.

Dr. Attia is host of The Drive podcast and is a world expert on behavioral approaches, nutritional interventions, supplementation and pharmacological techniques to improve lifespan, healthspan and athletic performance. We discuss how best to evaluate your health status using routine blood work, body scans and regular tests of physical strength and endurance. Dr. Attia explains what he uses with his patients to \u201cback-cast\u201d their health goals as a way to design their exercise and nutritional programs. We also discuss hormone modulation and replacement therapy for both men and women. We explain how cholesterol and related factors contribute to cardiovascular disease risk and how to monitor and mitigate that risk.

I discuss neuroplasticity and how the brain normally regulates mood, energy, and perceptions; then, I contrast that with the biology of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by extremes of energy and mood, e.g., mania and depression. I outline the mechanisms through which bipolar disorder manifests in the brain, including deficits of interoception and reduced connections between the parietal and limbic systems. I also outline how treatment options (such as lithium) work in part through homeostatic plasticity.\u2019 I discuss not only lithium but also the treatment of bipolar with ketamine, different talk therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and nutraceuticals, including Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation.

His laboratory explores the mechanisms of taste perception, focusing on how our conscious and unconscious processing of specific foods and nutrients guide our actions and behaviors. We discuss the neural circuits of taste,\u00a0the \u201cgut-brain axis,\u201d the basis of food cravings and the key difference between wanting (craving) and liking (perceiving) sugar. We also explore how taste perception relates to specific food satiety, thirst, to our emotions, and expectation. We also consider how sugar containing and highly-processed foods can hijack the natural balance of the taste and digestive systems. Dr. Zuker provides a true masterclass in the biology of taste and perception that ought to be of interest to anyone curious about how the brain works, our motivated behaviors and the neural, chemical perceptual aspects of the mind.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Charles Zuker & Taste Perception\n(00:03:22) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:35) Sensory Detection vs. Sensory Perception\n(00:11:48) Individual Variations within Perception, Color\n(00:16:20) Perceptions & Behaviors\n(00:20:19) The 5 Taste Modalities\n(00:26:18) Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste\n(00:28:00) Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons for Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor\n(00:30:14) Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception\n(00:34:02) Tongue \u201cTaste Map,\u201d Taste Buds & Taste Receptors\u00a0\n(00:39:34) Burning Your Tongue & Perception\n(00:42:54) The \u201cMeaning\u201d of Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence\n(00:51:55) Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior\n(00:56:16) Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion\u00a0\n(01:01:44) Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes over One\u2019s Lifetime\n(01:09:14) Integration of Odor & Taste, Influence on Behavior & Emotion\n(01:17:26) Sensitization to Taste, Internal State Modulation, Salt\n(01:24:05) Taste & Saliva: The Absence of Taste\n(01:28:10) Sugar & Reward Pleasure Centers; Gut-Brain Axis, Anticipatory Response\n(01:36:23) Vagus Nerve\n(01:43:09) Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis\n(01:52:03) Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite\n(01:54:06) Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis\u00a0\n(01:57:30) Nutrition, Gut-Brain Axis & Changes in Behavior\n(02:01:53) Fast vs. Slow Signaling & Reinforcement, Highly Processed Foods\u00a0\n(02:10:38) Favorite Foods: Enjoyment, Sensation & Context\n(02:15:58) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

            "content": "In this episode, I explain the science behind limb range of motion and flexibility and how to increase them by using science-supported protocols. Flexibility is crucial for physical movements and can help prevent injuries, decrease inflammation, modulate physical and mental pain, impact exercise recovery speed and even potentially slow the progression of certain diseases. I explain the biology of flexibility, including the specific neural mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions like the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement.

I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them.

                "summary": "This episode, I discuss grief and the challenges of processing losses of different kinds. I explain the biological mechanisms of grief, including how neural circuits for emotional and factual memory combine with those for love and attachment, to create feelings of absence and yearning. I discuss how grief is distinct from depression, yet why they can feel so similar. I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them. I also explain the importance of having and building strong foundational psychological and biological states so that we can better cope with grief when it happens. Finally, I describe tools to adjust those states, including those for accessing sleep, managing stress and emotional swings. This episode is for those suffering from grief but also for everyone, given that we all experience grief at some point in our lives.\nWe recorded this episode before the recent mass shooting tragedies in the United States. While we hope the information in this episode will be of use to anyone suffering from grief of any kind and at any time, we are also careful to acknowledge that many people require additional support and resources. For that reason, we include mention of such resources and we generally hope people will access them if needed.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Grief & Bereavement\u00a0\n(00:04:02) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:35) Grief vs. Depression, Complicated Grief\u00a0\n(00:12:20) Stages of Grief, Individual Variation for Grieving\u00a0\n(00:16:05) Grief: Lack & Motivation, Dopamine\n(00:23:15) Three Dimensions of Relationships\n(00:29:52) Tool: Remapping Relationships\n(00:37:15) Grief, Maintaining Emotional Closeness & Remapping\u00a0\n(00:44:40) Memories of Loved Ones & Remapping Attachments\u00a0\n(00:48:04) Yearning for Loved Ones: Memories vs. Reality, Episodic Memory\u00a0\n(00:51:40) Tools: Adaptively Processing Grief, Counterfactual Thinking, Phantom Limbs\n(01:00:32) Tool: Remembering Emotional Connection & Processing Grief\n(01:04:03) Memories, Hippocampal Trace Cells & Feeling An Absence\u00a0\n(01:10:14) Yearning & Oxytocin, Individualized Grief Cycles\u00a0\n(01:18:24) Tool: Complicated Grief & Adrenaline (Epinephrine)\n(01:24:37) Sentimental Attachment to Objects\u00a0\u00a0\n(01:26:13) Why do Some People Grieve More Quickly?

We discuss the four major categories of micronutrients that regulate cellular and organ stress and antioxidants, inflammation, hormone regulation, immune system, and longevity. Dr. Patrick provides actionable protocols for obtaining key micronutrients from food and/or supplement-based sources. Additionally, Dr. Patrick outlines protocols for deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure to benefit metabolism, cardiorespiratory fitness, mental health, and lifespan.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Rhonda Patrick \u2013 Micronutrients, Cold & Heat Exposure\u00a0\n(00:03:12) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT \n(00:09:42) Stress Response Pathways, Hormesis\n(00:16:38) Plants, Polyphenols, Sulforaphane\n(00:21:12) Tools 1: Sulforaphane - Broccoli Sprouts, Broccoli, Mustard Seed\u00a0\n(00:23:50) Tool 2: Moringa & Nrf2 Antioxidant Response\n(00:25:25) Sulforaphane: Antioxidants (Glutathione) & Air Pollution (Benzene Elimination)\u00a0\n(00:27:10) Plants & Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges\u00a0\n(00:29:35) Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2\u00a0\n(00:35:08) Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation\u00a0\n(00:48:40) EPA Omega-3s & Depression\u00a0\n(00:52:02) Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?\u00a0\n(00:54:23) Benefits of Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy\u00a0\n(00:59:24) Tool 4: Food Sources\u00a0of EPA\u00a0Omega-3s\u00a0\n(01:06:07) Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing\n(01:10:22) Benefits of Omega-3s\u00a0\n(01:14:40) Tool 5: Food Sources of DHA Omega-3s\n(01:17:07) Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure\u00a0\n(01:22:18) Role of Vitamin D, Gene Regulation\u00a0\n(01:25:30) Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation\u00a0\n(01:33:15) Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D\u00a0\n(01:34:23) Vitamin D & Longevity\n(01:36:46) Sun Exposure & Sunscreen\n(01:40:30) Role of Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables\n(01:44:50) Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate\u00a0\n(01:50:57) Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety\n(01:59:22) Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation\n(02:02:30) Tool 11: Cold & Fat \u2018Browning\u2019, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism\n(02:05:08) Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle\u00a0\n(02:08:04) Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna\u00a0\n(02:13:30) Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood\u00a0\n(02:17:45) Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory\n(02:19:53) Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer\u2019s and Dementia Risk\u00a0\n(02:25:30) Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)\u00a0\n(02:31:29) Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity\u00a0\n(02:33:22) Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility\u00a0\n(02:37:41) Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin\u00a0\n(02:41:37) Tools 18: Red Light Sauna?

I detail specific protocols to safely engage in deliberate cold exposure, including minimal exposure times, time-of-day effects, determining optimal temperatures, recovery, mindset, and movement during cold exposure. I discuss how cold exposure can be used to safely stress the body to improve attention, mood, and cognitive focus and boost metabolism and reduce inflammation. Also, I explain how cold exposure on specific regions of the body (called glabrous skin surfaces) can be leveraged to enhance endurance and weight training and increase work output.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Deliberate Cold Exposure, Health Warning\n(00:04:23) Tool: Moderate Exercise & Cognitive Work\n(00:11:04) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:15:37) Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature\n(00:18:41) Tool: Quickly Decrease Core Body Temperature, Glabrous Skin\n(00:25:26) Mental Effects of Cold Exposure\n(00:29:02) Physical Effects of Cold Exposure\n(00:30:11) How Cold Should the Temperature Be?\n(00:34:53) Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion\n(00:38:27) Protocols for Cold Exposure\n(00:50:57) Optimal Mindset(s) During Cold Exposure\n(00:55:26) Tool: Using Movement During Cold Exposure\n(00:57:51) Optimal Frequency of Cold Exposure\n(01:00:22) Cold Exposure for Dopamine, Mood & Focus\n(01:12:55) Cold Exposure & Metabolism, Brown Fat\n(01:25:55) Tool: Caffeine, Dopamine & Cold Exposure\n(01:29:14) Tools: Increasing Metabolism w/Cold \u2013 The S\u00f8berg Principle, Shivering\n(01:34:15) Norepinephrine & Fat Cells\n(01:36:22) Cold, Physical Performance, Inflammation\n(01:47:36) Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling\n(01:53:27) Tool: Palmar Cooling & Endurance\n(02:03:18) Cold Exposure to Groin, Increasing Testosterone\n(02:07:50) Tool: Optimal Timing for Daily Cold Exposure\n(02:11:16) Neural Network Newsletter, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify Reviews, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

I explain how the brain senses salt levels in our body and how that relates to our feelings of thirst. I cover the physiology of the renal system and the hormones that control sodium and water balance in our body. I also explore how salt interacts with stress and our immune systems and its crucial role in neuron function. Additionally, I examine research findings suggesting that some individuals might benefit from increased intake of sodium and other electrolytes (magnesium and potassium) to enhance mental performance, lessen anxiety, and offset dizziness. Yet, other people may need less sodium. I discuss how you can determine your optimal sodium intake and why sodium intake levels need to be uniquely tailored to an individual\u2019s lifestyle. Finally, I explain how salt creates \u2018hidden\u2019 sugars in many processed foods and the problems that can create.

Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed findings outlining salt\u2019s essential role in overall health and describe general recommendations and tools anyone can use to find their optimal salt balance and thereby enhance their brain and body\u2019s performance.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Role of Salt\u00a0\n(00:02:57) Neuropod Cells, Artificial Sweeteners & \u2018Hidden\u2019 Cravings\u00a0\n(00:10:36) Sponsors: AG1, Thesis\n(00:15:06) Salt Regulation\u00a0\n(00:17:13) How the Brain Senses Salt\n(00:24:15) Salt & Thirst\u00a0\n(00:29:27) Blood Pressure & Thirst\u00a0\n(00:33:47) Kidneys & Urine Regulation\n(00:39:08) Vasopressin: Roles in Libido & Urination\u00a0\n(00:45:46) How Much Salt Do You Need?\u00a0\n(00:56:45) Should You Increase Your Salt Intake?\u00a0\n(01:02:19) Tools: Determining Your Individual Salt Intake\n(01:14:02) Iodine, Sea Salt\u00a0\n(01:17:13) Salt: Roles in Stress & Anxiety\u00a0\n(01:24:20) Other Electrolytes: Magnesium & Potassium\u00a0\n(01:27:57) Tools: Effects of Low-carbohydrate Diets & Caffeine\u00a0\n(01:32:28) General Recommendations for Salt Intake\u00a0\n(01:36:34) Perception of Salt & Sugar Taste, Processed Foods\u00a0\n(01:47:13) Role of Sodium in Neuronal Function, Action Potentials\u00a0\n(01:53:13) Dehydration\u00a0\n(01:55:36) What Salt Intake is Best for You?\u00a0\n(02:00:58) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\u00a0\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

Dr. Sonnenburg\u2019s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and your environment shape your gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of your microbiome and how your mode of delivery into the world (C-section or not) shapes your gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter your microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating to other organs, including your brain. Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods (but not fiber) increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical in Western Diets (e.g., high fat, low fiber, processed foods) can negatively impact the gut microbiome.

In this episode, we examine the role of clinical hypnosis for the treatment of trauma, chronic pain, anxiety and more. Dr. Spiegel explains how to determine your level of \u2018hypnotizability\u2019 and provides case studies of incredible successes with hypnosis to treat a variety of ailments. We also discuss how breathing, vision and directed mental focus can modulate internal states and enhance performance. Additionally, we discuss how the adoption of self-hypnosis techniques can reduce stress and enhance sleep in anyone.

Dr. Crum is a world expert on mindsets and beliefs and how they shape our responses to stress, exercise, and even to the foods we eat. We discuss how our mindset about the nutritional content of food changes whether it is satisfying to us at a physiological (hormonal and metabolic) level. She also tells how mindsets about exercise can dramatically alter the effects of exercise on weight loss, blood pressure, and other health metrics. Dr. Crum teaches us how to think about stress in ways that allow stress to grow us and bring out our best rather than diminish our health and performance. Throughout the episode, Dr. Crum provides descriptions of high-quality peer-reviewed scientific findings that we can all leverage toward better health and performance in our lives.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introducing Dr. Alia Crum from Stanford University\n(00:03:31) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:26) What Is a Mindset & What Does It Do?\u00a0\n(00:14:45) Mindsets Change Our Biological Responses to Food\n(00:22:28) Beliefs About Our Food Matter\n(00:25:57) Placebo vs Beliefs vs Nocebo Effects\n(00:28:57) Mindset (Dramatically) Impacts the Effects of Exercise\n(00:33:44) Motivational Messaging & Mindset About Fitness\n(00:39:30) The Power of a \u2018Potency & Indulgence\u2019 Mindset\n(00:42:03) Mindsets About Sleep, Tracking Sleep\u00a0\n(00:45:00) Making Stress Work For (or Against) You\n(01:01:50) Mindsets Link Our Conscious & Subconscious\n(01:04:50) 3 Best Ways to Leverage Stress\n(01:10:40) 4 Things That Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets\n(01:19:40) Mindsets About Medicines & Side Effects\n(01:26:25) How to Teach Mindsets\n(01:31:47) Dr. Crum\u2019s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds\n(01:36:20) The Stanford Mind & Body Lab, Resources for Stress\n(01:38:30) Synthesis, Participating in Research\n(01:39:04) Subscribe, Sponsors, Instagram, Twitter, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

            "content": "In this episode, I review the science of habit formation and habit elimination and how the process of neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) underlies these processes.\nI describe two new systems for habit formation.

Dr. Sinclair is also the author of the book Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To, and the host of the Lifespan Podcast, which launches January 5, 2022.\u00a0\nIn this interview, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging and what we all can do to slow or reverse the aging process. We discuss fasting and supplementation with resveratrol, NAD, metformin, and NMN. We also discuss the use of caffeine, exercise, cold exposure, and why excessive iron load is bad for us. We discuss food choices for offsetting aging and promoting autophagy (clearance of dead cells). And we discuss the key blood markers everyone should monitor to determine your biological versus chronological age. We also discuss the future of longevity research and technology.

Dr. Sinclair is also the author of the book Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To, and the host of the Lifespan Podcast, which launches January 5, 2022.\u00a0\nIn this interview, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging and what we all can do to slow or reverse the aging process. We discuss fasting and supplementation with resveratrol, NAD, metformin, and NMN. We also discuss the use of caffeine, exercise, cold exposure, and why excessive iron load is bad for us. We discuss food choices for offsetting aging and promoting autophagy (clearance of dead cells). And we discuss the key blood markers everyone should monitor to determine your biological versus chronological age. We also discuss the future of longevity research and technology.

            "content": "In this episode, I discuss fear and trauma, including the neural circuits involved in the \"threat reflex\" and how specific experiences and memories come to activate that system. I also discuss how our body is involved in trauma and fear. First, I describe the logic of fear mechanisms and how \"top-down\" processing-- meaning connections from the parts of the brain that assign meaning to our feelings, are involved in fear and erasing fears and traumas. Then I discuss what successful fear and trauma treatment must include and consider various treatments for whether they meet that standard, such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ketamine, other drug-assisted therapies, and more.

Throughout the episode, I use the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction: Gratitude Science & Surprises\n(00:01:50) Controlling Heart Rate with Story\n(00:04:48) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:09:11) Major, Long-Lasting Benefits of Gratitude Practice\n(00:12:20) Prosocial vs. Defensive Thinking, Behaviors, & Neural Circuits\u00a0\n(00:17:50) Why We All Need an Effective Gratitude Practice\n(00:21:22) Neurochemistry & Neural Circuits of Gratitude\n(00:25:10) Prefrontal Cortex Set Context\n(00:30:10) Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables\n(00:34:55) Key Features of Effective Gratitude Practices: Receiving Thanks & Story\n(00:42:30) Theory of Mind Is Key\n(00:45:50) Building Effective Gratitude Practices: Adopting Narratives, Duration\n(00:52:28) Narratives That Shift Brain-Body Circuits\u00a0\n(00:56:150 You Can\u2019t Lie About Liking Something; Reluctance In Giving\n(00:59:55) How Gratitude Changes Your Brain: Reduces Anxiety, Increases Motivation\n(01:03:00) 5 Minutes (Is More Than Enough), 3X Weekly, Timing Each Day\u00a0\n(01:05:44) Empathy & Anterior Cingulate Cortex\n(01:07:35) Reducing Inflammation & Fear with Gratitude\n(01:10:56) Serotonin, Kanna/Zembrin\u00a0\n(01:16:00) Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology, Brain Machine Interfaces\n(01:18:50) The Best Gratitude Practices: & How To, My Protocol\n(01:24:25) Subscribe & Feedback, Supporting Sponsors, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

            "content": "In this episode, I discuss how our brain and body track time and the role that neurochemicals, in particular dopamine and serotonin, but also hormones such as melatonin, allow us to orient ourselves in time. I review the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. I also discuss circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time. I explain the mechanisms of that subconscious control. And I cover the ultradian (90 minutes) rhythms that govern our ability to focus, including how to track when these 90-minute rhythms begin and end for the sake of work and productivity.

We discuss specific resistance (weight) training regimens for increasing testosterone in men and women and how to vary mechanical loads and rest between sets and workouts to optimize hormone output and training results. We also discuss how stress-induced \"catecholamines\" can increase testosterone or decrease it, depending on duration and mindset. And we discuss specific cold- and heat- therapies for increasing resilience, reducing inflammation, heat shock proteins and more. We discuss nutrition for training and how to match nutrition to training goals and metabolic flexibility. We discuss mental focus and how long to train for skill development. Finally, we discuss how mixed martial arts and the UFC Performance Institute are a template for exploring human performance more generally.

Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite, and mental health. We discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep-wake cycle for you. We also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight savings leads to outsized effects on our biking because of the way that our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days.

Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite, and mental health. We discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep-wake cycle for you. We also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight savings leads to outsized effects on our biking because of the way that our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days. And he offers precise tools to rapidly adjust to jetlag, shift work, and reset your clock after a late night of work or socializing. This episode is filled with cutting-edge data on the biological mechanisms of human physiology and practical tools for people of all ages.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introducing Dr. Samer Hattar, Ph.D.\n(00:02:33) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:06:15) Light, Circadian (24 hour) & Circannual (365 day) \u201cPhotoentrainment\u201d\u00a0\n(00:14:30) Neurons in Our Eyes That Set Our Body Clocks: Similar to Frog Skin\n(00:18:55) What Blind People See\u00a0\n(00:20:15) When, How & How Long to View Light for Optimal Sleep & Wakefulness\n(00:30:20) Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps\n(00:33:48) Are You Jetlagged at Home?

I also review data on creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline, glutamine and how they each impact brain function in healthy people seeking to reinforce and improve their cognition and in those combatting cognitive decline. I describe both food-based and supplement-based sources for these compounds, and their effective dose ranges based on peer-reviewed literature.\nThen I review the 3 factors: gut-brain signaling, perceived taste, and learned associations that combine with the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects of food to determine what foods we seek and prefer. Amazingly, it's not just about what tastes good to us. Next, I explore how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. I also review new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental,\u00a0in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation.

I describe both food-based and supplement-based sources for these compounds, and their effective dose ranges based on peer-reviewed literature.\nThen I review the 3 factors: gut-brain signaling, perceived taste, and learned associations that combine with the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects of food to determine what foods we seek and prefer. Amazingly, it's not just about what tastes good to us. Next, I explore how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. I also review new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental,\u00a0in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation.

                "summary": "This episode I discuss the science and practice of fasting also called time-restricted feeding. I review the data on how limiting food intake to specific portions of every 24-hour cycle (or fasting longer) impacts weight loss, fat loss specifically, liver health, mental focus, muscle, longevity and more. I explain how \"fasted\" is contextual, and relates to blood glucose levels and their downstream effects, and how the depth of fasting can be adjusted with behaviors such as different types of exercise, or with glucose disposal agents. I also discuss the optimal fasting protocol: and both the absolute (non-negotiable) and variable (contextual) features of a fasting/time-restricted-feeding protocol that will allow you to get the most benefits. I also discuss what does and does not break a fast, the effects of fasting on hormones like testosterone and cortisol and on fertility. I also review how different feeding windows of 8 or 10 or 4 hours differentially impact the effects of fasting, and why the classic 8 hour feeding window came to be but also might be ideal. I discuss mechanisms and offer tools to discern the optimal fasting duration and timing for you.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction, Blood Glucose & Mortality, Mice Vs.

We discuss how the body and brain maintain temperature under different conditions and how most everyone uses the wrong approach to cool off or heat up. Dr. Heller teaches us the best ways and in doing so, explains how to offset hyperthermia and hypothermia. He also explains how we can use the precise timing and location of cooling on our body to greatly enhance endurance and weight training performance. He describes how cooling technology discovered and engineered in his laboratory has led to a tripling of anaerobic (weight training) performance and allowed endurance athletes to run further and faster, as well as to eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness. Dr. Heller explains how heat impairs muscular and mental performance, and how to cool the brain to reduce inflammation and to enhance sleep and cognition.

            "content": "This episode serves as a sort of \u201cDopamine Masterclass\u201d. I discuss the immensely powerful chemical that we all make in our brain and body: dopamine. I describe what it does and the neural circuits involved. I explain dopamine peaks and baselines, and the cell biology of dopamine depletion.

            "content": "This episode I discuss medical research on psychedelic compounds with Dr. Matthew Johnson, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. We discuss the biology and medical clinical-trial uses of psilocybin, MDMA, ayahuasca, DMT, and LSD.\u00a0Dr. Johnson teaches us what the clinical trials in his lab are revealing about the potential these compounds hold for the treatment of depression, addiction, trauma, eating disorders, ADHD, and other disorders of the mind. Dr. Johnson describes a typical psychedelic experiment in his laboratory, start to finish, including the conditions for optimal clinical outcomes. And he explains some of the potential hazards and common misconceptions and pitfalls related to psychedelic medicine. Dr. Johnson explains flashbacks, the heightened risks of certain people and age groups using psychedelics and the ever evolving legal and pharmaceutical industry landscape surrounding psychedelics.

I discuss the role of dopamine in coordinating 'default-mode' and 'task-related' neural networks, attentional \"blinks\" (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, I review some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD).\nThe role of cell phones/technology in ADHD and ADHD-like challenges with focus are also discussed.

I also address how protein is assimilated better early in the day than it is later in the day, and why those using intermittent fasting might want to shift their feeding window to earlier in the day.\nThen I delve into the topic of disorders of eating: Anorexia Nervosa, where people starve themselves and Bulimia Nervosa where people binge and purge their food. I discuss some common myths about Anorexia such as the role of media images increasing the rates of anorexia and the myth of the \"perfectionist\" anorexic. I also review the symptoms, and the brain and chemical systems disrupted in this condition. I explain how anorexics become hyperaware of the fat content of foods and develop reflexive habits of fat-hyperawareness. Then I discuss the most effective treatments ranging from family-based models to those that target the habitual nature of low-fat/calorie food choices. I also discuss new more experimental clinical trials on MDMA, Psilocybin and Ibogaine for Anorexia, and both their promise and risks\nI review the latest work on binge eating disorder and brain stimulation, drug treatments and thyroid disruption in Bulimia and why the treatments for Bulimia are so similar to those for ADHD.

Dr. Sapolsky explains some of the key effects of the hormone testosterone \u2014 how it can amplify pre-existing tendencies for aggression or sexual behavior, but that it does not produce those behaviors per se. He also explains how testosterone impacts our social hierarchies, sense of confidence, and willingness to embrace challenges of different kinds. He also explains how our behaviors and perceptions shape testosterone levels. And we discuss estrogen and the powerful role it plays in brain development, health and longevity.

I also discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, I review how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression, especially treatment-resistant major depression.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Mood Disorders & Maintaining Mental Health (Protocol 1)\n(00:07:25) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:11:15) Major Depression\n(00:18:40) \u201cAnti-Self\u201d Confabulation\n(00:21:42) Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms of Depression\n(00:26:58) Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin\n(00:31:50) SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors\n(00:37:00) Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving, Serotonin/Emotions\n(00:39:33) Physical & Emotional Pain are Linked: Substance P\n(00:41:50) Hormones & Depression: Thyroid & Cortisol\u00a0\n(00:46:50) Genetic Susceptibility to Depression: Impact of Stress\u00a0\n(00:50:50) Understanding Biological Mechanism Is Key: Recipes versus Skills\n(00:52:50) Tools for Dealing with Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)\n(00:56:25) Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.\n(00:59:20) Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*\n(01:02:50) How EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine, Quinolinic Acid\n(01:05:25) Protocol 4: How Exercise Offsets Depression\u00a0\n(01:11:44) Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*\n(01:20:30) Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function\n(01:33:08) Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) for Major Depression: Psilocybin*\n(01:47:00) Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)\n(01:54:50) Summary of Protocols Covered\n(02:00:10) Support & Additional Resources\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

I discuss the science of behavioral tools like acupuncture and hypnosis and directed pressure, including the neural circuits they each activate to modulate our experience of pain or pleasure. I also discuss whole body pain, pain \"syndromes\" and novel pain relief compounds such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, SAMe and Agmatine.

The conscious awareness of this brain-body dialogue is called interoception.

I explain how specific actions of our lungs, heart, spleen, and diaphragm, control our brain via the vagus nerve and other neural pathways.

I describe 11 science-supported protocols for enhancing brain-body health and the logic behind them.\nAccess the full show notes for this episode at hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Your Sense of Self: Interoception\n(00:01:25) Protocol 1: Fermented Foods, Not Fiber, to Reduce Inflammation\u00a0\n(00:03:45) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:22) Main Drivers of Feelings & Performance\n(00:11:45) Brain-Body: A Mechanical & Chemical Dialogue\u00a0\n(00:17:50) LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue\u00a0\u00a0\n(00:21:00) Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate With Breathing\n(00:29:08) Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors\n(00:30:54) Carbon Dioxide, From Air to Blood\n(00:34:02) Protocol 5: Alert While Calm\n(00:40:50) Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex\n(00:42:47) Gut Volume & The Desire to Open Your Mouth\u00a0\n(00:48:18) Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting\u00a0\n(00:51:50) Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar\n(00:57:00) Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings with Specific Amino Acid Nutrients\u00a0\n(00:58:58) Gut Acidity (Is Good)\n(01:02:20) Improving Nasal Microbiome\u00a0\n(01:04:13) Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented\u00a0\n(01:11:15) Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented Foods\n(01:13:10) Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine\n(01:15:50) Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin\n(01:18:30) Probiotics & Brain Fog\n(01:21:45) Nausea: Happens in Your Brain; Area Postrema\n(01:28:25) Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.\n(01:30:40) Fever: Triggers and Control Knobs: OVLT\n(01:37:00) Protocol 10: Cooling the Blood Properly\n(01:38:53) Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress\n(01:41:50) Mental Emotions Reflect Bodily Conditions\n(01:45:00) Sensing Other People\u2019s Emotions via the Body\n(01:46:00) Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat\u00a0\n(01:50:40) Conclusions & Resources\nDisclaimer"

I also describe how we can train and support our visual system to improve at any age. I describe more than a dozen protocols to support depth perception, offset near-sightedness, improve mood, sleep, and our ability to focus (both visual focus and our mental focus generally).

I describe the four kinds of endurance: muscular endurance, long duration (single-set) efforts, and the two kinds of high intensity interval training (HIIT). I discuss efficiency of effort and maximizing quality of effort, and a hydration formula. I review how our heart literally gets stronger when we oxygenate muscles properly. I also discuss motivation for long bouts of work and the visual physiological basis of the \"extra gear\" we all can leverage for effort.

I also describe how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise.

I describe the three areas of our body that can remove heat (or bring heat into the body) faster than anywhere else, why that is so, and how proper cooling of these areas with specific protocols can allow people to perform 200-600% more volume and repetitions of resistance exercises at the same weight loads, or to run, cycle or swim significantly further. I also describe how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise. Also, why the common practices of trying to heat up or cool the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in cold can be inefficient and/or dangerous-- and the better alternatives.

Finally, I review the scientific data and tools for timing the release of these hormones to improve memory, energy and immune system function.\nAccess the full show notes, including referenced articles, resources and more at hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:00:31) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:05:41) Energy & Your Immune System, & Learning Faster\n(00:08:34) Why & How Intermittent Fasting Increases Growth Hormone\n(00:11:56) Why Your Stomach Growls\n(00:13:09) Hot Baths & Hormones\n(00:14:35) Energy, Adrenaline (Epinephrine), & Cortisol\n(00:15:48) Cortisol & Cholesterol, Competition With Testosterone & Estrogen\n(00:17:54) Adrenaline (Epinephrine) Is Your (Immune Systems) Best Friend\n(00:18:48) Cortisol Basics In Two (Actually 1) Minute/s\n(00:19:48) Adrenaline Basics In Two Minutes\n(00:21:32) Tool: Time Your Cortisol Peak To Waking Using Specific Light Intensities\n(00:27:20) Brief Increases In Cortisol & Adrenaline Boost Energy, Focus & Immunity\n(00:30:04) Ways To Increase Adrenaline, Epinephrine & Cortisol & Why That Is Good\n(00:35:00) Does Mindset During Stress Matter?\n(00:36:15) Protocols: Adrenaline Breathing Described\n(00:39:00) Practices To Increase Energy Without Increasing Stress\n(00:45:00) Using Stressors to ENHANCE Our Immune System: Science & Tools\n(00:55:11) Timing Thyroid Release For Energy\n(00:57:02) Adrenaline/Stress Increase Performance & Memory.

            "content": "This episode I discuss how hormones from our gut, liver, pancreas and brain control our appetite--and the specific tools we can use to adjust those hormones in order to achieve specific goals. I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering release of the hormone CCK, and more.\nNote: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone. Also, I mis-spoke when explaining POMC neurons. I said \u201cP-M-O-C\u201d but should have said \u201cPOMC\u201d. Apologies.

            "content": "In this episode, I discuss testosterone and estrogen hormones and how they impact the brain, body, and behavior after puberty. I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: \"what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?\"; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways, it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen.

I describe the predictable relationship between genes, beard growth and balding patterns, and the importance of estrogen for brain development in people of all chromosomal sexes. Finally, I discuss how the hormones we are exposed to in the womb shape the relative length of our finger digits, the sounds our ears make (yes you read that correctly), and how those correlate with people's self-reports of their sexual preferences.

Other topics discussed include how heat versus cold impacts neurons and wounds, red-light, sunlight, stem cells and more.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction/Avenues for Support\n(00:00:31) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT, Waking Up\n(00:04:58) Deliberate Unlearning\n(00:06:43) Pain, Injury and Regeneration\n(00:09:17) A System of Touch (Somatosensation)\n(00:11:42) Pain and Injury are Dissociable\n(00:15:19) Objective versus Subjective Control of Experience\n(00:16:15) Plasticity of Perception\n(00:16:41) Lack of Pain Is Self-Destructive; So Is Excessive Pain\n(00:18:42) Homoculous, Ratonculous, Dogunculus\n(00:19:05) \u201cSensitivity\u201d explained\n(00:21:30) Inflammation\n(00:22:24) Phantom Limb Pain\n(00:24:00) Top-down Relief of Pain by Vision\n(00:26:41) From Deaf to Hearing Sounds\n(00:28:10) Pain Is In The Mind & Body\n(00:29:44) Recovering Movement Faster After Injury\n(00:35:00) Don\u2019t Over Compensate\n(00:37:34) Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing\n(00:40:49) The Brain\u2019s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance\n(00:43:05) Body Position & Angle During Sleep\n(00:44:30) Types of Exercise For Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health\n(00:47:33) Ambulance Cells in The Brain\n(00:49:20) True Pain Control by Belief and Context\n(00:51:45) Romantic Love and Pain\n(00:55:05) Dopaminergic Control of Pain\n(00:57:15) Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment\n(01:07:32) Vagus Activation and Autonomic Control of Pain\n(01:08:30) Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead and DHT\n(01:11:40) Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, \u201cSuper-Oxygenation\u201d Breathing\n(01:14:53) Protocols For Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain\n(01:17:55) Ice Is Not Always Nice (For Pain and Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.\n(01:22:02) Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight\n(01:26:10) Glymphatics and Sleep\n(01:26:29) Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds and Should Nots\n(01:31:38) Young Blood: Actual Science\n(01:35:44) Synthesis, Support & Resources\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer"

We also discuss existing and emerging tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works.\nAndrew Huberman, Ph.D., is a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology, and by courtesy, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills and cognitive functioning.\u00a0\nHuberman\u00a0is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award, given to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision, in 2017. His lab\u2019s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. He also works on neural regeneration and directs a clinical trial to promote visual restoration in diseases that cause blindness.\u00a0Huberman is also actively involved in developing tools now in use by the elite military in the U.S. and Canada, athletes, and technology industries to optimize performance in high stress environments, enhance neural plasticity, mitigate stress and optimize sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\nWork from the\u00a0Huberman\u00a0Laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine has been published in top journals including Nature, Science and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover and other top media outlets.\u00a0\nIn 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab podcast. The podcast is frequently ranked in the top 5 of all podcasts globally and is often ranked #1 in the categories of Science, Education, and Health & Fitness."
