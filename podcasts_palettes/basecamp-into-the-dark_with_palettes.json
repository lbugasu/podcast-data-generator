In this episode, Dr. Joel Muddamalle gives the Biblical background for the origin of the demonic and much of the spiritual world. Joel and Jeremy also discuss spiritual warfare and how the Bible should inform our outlook on it and the evangelism that is sure to bring it about.</p>\n<p>Find out more about Dr. Joel Muddamalle: https://muddamalle.com/</p>\n<p>Follow ATAP on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/allthings.allpeople/</p>\n<p>Find out more about ATAP: https://www.allthingsallpeople.org/</p>\n"

After a tweet where she questioned recent rulings regarding transgender rights, she was singled out by members of the student body at her school, Baylor University, as \"transphobic\". Dr. Crenshaw has stood against these claims and fought for her voice to be heard and with it the orthodox Christian view on gender.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Dr. Crenshaw talks about the unlikely place she has found herself, never having thought she would be in a position like the one she is now. They discuss the need to show grace to have our voices heard and to stand for truth in a way that invites questions. Dr. Crenshaw is a true Christian thinker and it was an honor to have her on the All Things All People Podcast.</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Crenshaw on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/christina_crenshaw/</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Crenshaw on Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrenshawPhD</p>\n<p>Follow Jeremy on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/allthings.allpeople/</p>\n<p>Email Jeremy: Jeremy@allthingsallpeople.org</p>\n"
