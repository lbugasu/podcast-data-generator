                    "itunes:summary": "When asked to describe his calling, Civil Rights leader John Perkins launches instead into a detailed explanation of his long and morphing relationship with the Bible. Perkins\u2019 story moves from confusion to clarity, and ultimately ends in resolve and redemption. Having grown up in poverty, Perkins found hope in the promises of God, and he took them to heart. But he didn\u2019t just take the good stuff to heart. He also took to heart the challenges and warnings scripture had for both him and his world. In his later years, Perkins demonstrates a distinct comfort with the kinds of tensions we find in scripture: between repentance and hope, justice and forgiveness. In 1960, Perkins and his wife Vira Mae moved from California, back to Mendenhall, Mississippi to put into practice his philosophy of what it means to minister to the poor. Though he spent much of his energy implementing a daycare center, a church, a youth program, and many other benevolent programs, in his community, Perkins also took a prominent role among ongoing Civil Rights activism. As a result, he built up his community while also running into a host of physical push-back, oftentimes being imprisoned and even beaten for his beliefs and actions. Along with his wife, he started a foundation dedicated to justice, reconciliation, and community development. Now 88 years old, he\u2019s focused on clarifying and documenting the experience and wisdom he\u2019s developed over the years. In the final episode of CT\u2019s The Calling, host Richard Clark talks with Perkins about his experience growing up in the midst of unjust laws, the double-edged sword of forgiveness, and his fear of falling short of faithfulness in the end.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

What is surprising, however, is the number of ways in which he\u2019s managed to do it. Whether serving as lead pastor for Tampa\u2019s multi-ethnic, multi-generational Crossover Church, performing hip-hop and spoken word concerts around the world, or writing books like Un.orthodox or ReBuild, Kyllonen has spent the last 20 years in ministry venture after ministry venture, bringing the gospel into every available nook and cranny of the city he calls home. But for someone who\u2019s so keen on serving in neighborhoods where many churches won\u2019t go, there are still some lines Urban D. won\u2019t cross. For instance, while he\u2019s been at the forefront of cultivating a hip-hop-friendly culture at Crossover, he\u2019s also learned the hard way that when a church copies the world\u2019s culture rather than creating one of its own, it can lead to confusion over what that church is really all about. If that tension sounds familiar, you\u2019re not alone.

Although her books and articles have addressed such difficult topics as fear, sexual brokenness, and the need for diversity in the church, Newbell has a reputation for facing down darkness with an unshakable buoyancy. As she herself writes, \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic because I\u2019m na\u00efve (at least not completely) or because I think there isn\u2019t evil in the world (my heart often proves otherwise) but because of the gospel.\u201d Despite Newbell\u2019s successes as a writer and women\u2019s ministry leader, however, her hope hasn\u2019t been won easily. Like many whose day-to-day lives are shaped by ministry\u2019s demands, she still struggles to balance her vocational service to the body of Christ with involvement in her local church. Newbell joined CT managing editor Richard Clark for this week\u2019s episode of The Calling, where she shares her wisdom on dividing one\u2019s time between one\u2019s calling and one\u2019s congregation\u2014stopping along the way to discuss the draw of Twitter debates, the joys of parenthood, and how remembering that we\u2019re the worst helps us to love others best.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

With an omnivorous mind and an eye for the unusual, Leithart seems to have written about almost everything, from Shakespeare\u2019s plays and Jane Austen\u2019s novels to the meaning of baptism and the legacy of Athanasius. Whatever he\u2019s working on, though, he always aims to connect the mind to the soul\u2014especially when it means helping ministers to minister better. Before his present successes, however, Leithart encountered his fair share of ministerial tribulation. Coming out of seminary, he intended to move straight into a career writing and teaching theology. Instead, he found himself stepping into a head pastor position with little experience and a host of demands, including helping a couple whose failing marriage was tearing his church apart. The experience taught him a lot about failure\u2014especially how God redeems it. Thankfully, though, that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. On this week\u2019s episode of The Calling, Leithart chats with CT managing editor Richard Clark about his calling past and present, from his early desire to be a professional comedian to the theology that drives his current voracious intellectual appetite.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
