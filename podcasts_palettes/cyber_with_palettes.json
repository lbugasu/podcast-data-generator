We saw members of <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdnam/audio-recording-claims-neo-nazi-terror-group-is-disbanding\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Atomwaffen Division</a>\u2014a Nazi terror group that was already connected to murders and a chilling plot to bomb a nuclear power plant\u2014and right-wing trolls alike, some of which were gaining the attentions of federal authorities that worried about another <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/us/Timothy-McVeigh-Oklahoma-City-Bombing-Coronavirus.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oklahoma City bombing</a>, all linked to Spear.</p><p>Then Spear started tweeting about what was one of the most ambitious plots coming out of the American far-right movement to date: funneling all the disparate worlds of extremists, activists, and trolls festering all over social media after the election of President Trump in 2016, into one trained and networked, IRL coalition fighting for a \u201crace war\u201d. What he started as a WordPress site and an entrance application, Spear grew into \u2018the Base;\u2019 a bonafide terror group, with over 50 members, operating both in the real world at paramilitary camps, and online using encrypted apps like Wire and Riot.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, by January 2020, the Base would make chilling news: <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/akwvpj/fbi-arrests-members-of-neo-nazi-cell-whose-plot-to-murder-antifa-couple-was-foiled-by-a-bad-back\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">An assassination plot</a>, plans to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7qv5v/fbi-arrests-members-of-neo-nazi-group-including-canadian-soldier-hiding-in-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shoot up a political rally</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/pa75jk/man-arrested-for-synagogue-vandalism-was-active-in-two-militant-neo-nazi-groups\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">national campaign to vandalize synagogues</a>. In the end, the FBI deployed an undercover into the Base and undertook a nationwide crackdown on the group raiding apartments and homes in Delaware, Marylan, Georgia, Wisconsin and New Jersey, nabbing 9 members. But Spear, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/revealed-the-true-identity-of-the-leader-of-americas-neo-nazi-terror-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">who was revealed to be</a> a 47 year-old American and ex-Pentagon contractor (<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7qdzv/neo-nazi-terror-leader-said-to-have-worked-with-us-special-forces\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">who worked with the special forces</a>) named Rinaldo Nazzaro, never went to jail. Instead, he continues to allegedly live in Russia, where he is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51236915\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">suspected of being a Kremlin asset</a>.</p><p>In a two-part series for CYBER\u2014using secret recordings, sources coming from inside the group, and never before heard materials\u2014we\u2019ll dive deep into the birth and demise of what became one of the most prominent and dangerous American far-right organizations in the modern era.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the story of the Base.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
