We\u2019ll also explore how money complicates the way we grieve, and what it&#8217;s like to receive a huge windfall from beyond the grave. We share one man\u2019s philosophy of how to redistribute wealth to build the community he wants to live in. And we\u2019ll take a look back at the past 10 seasons of TIU and what we\u2019ve learned along the way.
