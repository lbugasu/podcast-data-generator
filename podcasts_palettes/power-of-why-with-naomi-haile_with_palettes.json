But happiness comes from helping other people to live happier lives.\"\n\u2060Stephanie\u2060's childhood joy revolved around self-expression \u2014corralling her siblings and neighbors to put on musicals, performing with a voice-altering karaoke machine, reading, and making things.\u00a0\nIt's what shaped a lot of her early years.\nFor many years, she \"lost\" that self-expression and only started to re-discover it again in her late 20s.\nWhat she learned is that acceptance of the creative process is a rejection of everything that she had been conditioned to believe:\u00a0\n\n \"You have to be perfect.\"\n \"You can never make mistakes.\"\n \"You have to follow this set path.\"\n \"You have to know exactly where you're going.\"\n\nThese are lies.\nCreativity has none of that. You must let go of those ideas to do things according to your creativity.\u00a0\nToday, Stephanie Harrison is an expert in the science of happiness and the creator of The New Happy philosophy and company. Founded in 2018, \u2060The New Happy\u2060 has revolutionized how people understand and pursue happiness.\nThe New Happy reaches millions of people worldwide every month through resources and tools.

They became her mantra, helping her find and build her inner strength.</p>\n<p>Angela was removed from her mother at birth and was placed into the child welfare system. Throughout her tumultuous childhood, she had no safe place to call home. From surviving abuse and homelessness, Angela emerged as her hero, crediting her survival to education, spirituality, and art.</p>\n<p>Today, Angela leverages her decades of training and expertise to help others empower themselves. She consults with organizations on workplace wellness, puts pen to paper on her forthcoming book, and coaches individuals on overcoming their trauma.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here is how she identified her inner strength and resilience in adversity. This episode is for you if: You want to reclaim your identity in the face of adversity.

Whether it's long journeys or daily commutes, she yearned for classic and casual styles with a story. After a trip to Ethiopia, her father, Dagne Tedla, brought several leather goods home as gifts for friends and family, only to realize that he needed to go back to Addis Ababa for more! Thus, the birth of UnoEth began.\n\nUpon embarking on this new adventure and with a background in Merchandising and Marketing, Xiomara only wanted to deliver quality and timeless pieces that could be worn for years on end, surpassing trendy styles and fads. All UnoEth goods are handmade, 100% Ethiopian leather, and crafted by artisans and small businesses in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\u00a0\n\nYou can connect with Xiomara and UnoEth here:\nUnoEth Website: https://unoeth.com/\u00a0\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/unoeth\u00a0\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/unoeth\u00a0\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/unoeth\u00a0\n\nYou can connect with Naomi here:\u00a0\nWebsite: www.naomihaile.com\u00a0\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/naomiahaile/\u00a0\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomihail/\u00a0\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/naomiathaile \u00a0\n",
