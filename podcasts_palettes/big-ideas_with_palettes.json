Drawing on her own childhood, she asks, how can educators better foster these? We're in the middle of an attack on our essential nature, Astra argues, with confronting consequences for our society and state of mind.\u00a0In this 5 part\u00a0CBC Massey lecture series, Astra explores how our society now runs on a sense of manufactured insecurity \u2014 and what needs to change."
