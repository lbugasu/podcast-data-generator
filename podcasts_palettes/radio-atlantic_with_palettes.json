Don\u2019t do it, until you hear what Atlantic staff writer Amanda Mull has to say about the cratering quality of knitwear. For years I\u2019ve wondered why my sweaters pilled so quickly, or why they suffocated me, or smelled like tires. And then I read Mull\u2019s recent story, \u201cYour Sweaters Are Garbage.\u201d It turns out that international trade agreements, greedy entrepreneurs, and my own lack of willpower have conspired to erode my satisfaction.\nIn this episode, Hanna talks with Amanda Mull\u2014who writes the Atlantic column \u201cMaterial World\u201d\u2014about why so many consumer goods have declined in quality over the last two decades. As always, Mull illuminates the stories the fashion world works hard to obscure, about the quality of fabrics, the nature of working conditions, and about how to subvert a system that wants you to keep buying more. \u201cI have but one human body,\u201d she says. \u201cI can only wear so many sweaters.\u201d\nWant to share unlimited access to The Atlantic with your loved ones?

As a result, many Democrats blamed the progressive party for Clinton\u2019s electoral college loss and have worked this year to keep the party from competing in key states. Following Democrats\u2019 challenges over paperwork issues, courts in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania removed Green Party names from presidential ballots this week.\n\nHowie Hawkins, the Green Party\u2019s nominee for president and a co-founder of the party, joins Isaac Dovere to discuss his candidacy. Is the Green Party being used as a spoiler? What does he make of Kanye West\u2019s presidential campaign? And does he fear his party may again face accusations that they put Donald Trump in the White House?\n\nSupport this show and all of The Atlantic\u2019s journalism by becoming a subscriber at: theatlantic.com/supportus\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                    "itunes:summary": "Allegations of sexual harassment (and more) by powerful men in numerous industries have been leading news reports across America. On-the-record accounts of disturbing behavior are proliferating. Several leaders of prominent companies have been forced out of their positions. Does this represent a lasting shift in attitudes toward scandalous conduct, or will the public's interest in these matters subside? Is this a tipping point, in other words, or a flash point?\nThe journalism of Jodi Kantor, Katie Benner, and their colleagues at The New York Times has been a major catalyst for putting this issue at the top of the national agenda. Kantor and her reporting partner Megan Twohey shared a byline on the October 5 investigation revealing three decades of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein. As a technology reporter based in Silicon Valley, Benner has chronicled numerous reports of predatory behavior by investors, founders, and other influential figures in the tech industry. In this episode of Radio Atlantic, Kantor and Benner join Alex and Matt to discuss what they've discovered in their reporting, and where they think it will lead.\nLinks: \n- \"Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades\" (Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, The New York Times, 10/5/2017)\n- \"How the Harvey Weinstein Story Has Unfolded\" (Daniel Victor, The New York Times, 10/18/2017)\n- \"Women in Tech Speak Frankly on Culture of Harassment\" (Katie Benner, The New York Times, 6/30/2017)\n- \"'It Was a Frat House': Inside the Sex Scandal That Toppled SoFi's C.E.O.\" (Katie Benner and Nathaniel Popper, The New York Times) | SoFi's response\n- \u201cThe \u2018Harvey Effect\u2019 Takes Down Leon Wieseltier\u2019s Magazine\u201d (Adrienne LaFrance, The Atlantic, 10/24/2017)\n- \"Harvey Weinstein and the Economics of Consent\" (Brit Marling, The Atlantic, 10/23/2017)\n- \"Girl at a Bar\" (Saturday Night Live)\n- Startup, especially seasons two and four\n- The Burning Girl (Claire Messud)\n- The Color of Law(Richard Rothstein)\n- Uncivil\n- Scene on Radio: Seeing White\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Through conversations\u2014and sometimes sharp debates\u2014with the most insightful thinkers and writers on topics of the day, Radio Atlantic will complicate overly simplistic views. It will cut through the noise with clarifying, personal narratives. It will, hopefully, help listeners make up their own mind about certain ideas.\nThe national conversation right now can be chaotic, reckless, and stuck. Radio Atlantic aims to bring some order to our thinking\u2014and encourage listeners to be purposeful about how they unstick their mind.",
