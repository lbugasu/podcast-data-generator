It's an opportunity to ask questions about your reproductive health, from birth control to painful periods to a decreased interest in sex. Dr. Rachel Bervell, co-founder of The Black OBGYN Project, explains how women and trans or non-binary people can structure their next visit \u2014 and get the answers they need.                                                                   A previous version of this podcast defined endometriosis as a condition that happens when menstrual tissue that's supposed to be in the womb ends up outside the womb. It would have been more accurate to mention that gynecologists disagree on the origin of endometriosis. Some believe endometrial tissue originates in the uterus and migrates outside of the womb.
