Their spacesuits will be very different from what Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin wore when they walked the lunar surface in 1969. Spacesuits today are thinner and lighter, while still making sure astronauts can complete tasks and stay alive. In this conversation from the Future of Everything festival in May, WSJ\u2019s Danny Lewis speaks to Amy Ross, one of NASA\u2019s top spacesuit engineers. She explains how the lessons learned from designing next-generation moon suits will eventually help astronauts explore Mars, while leading to other innovations here on Earth.\n\n\n\nFurther reading:\n\nNASA, Canadian Space Agency Select Astronauts for Artemis Moon Mission\u00a0\n\nNASA's New Artemis Spacesuits Are Designed to Put a Woman on the Moon\u00a0\n\nNASA Plans to Bring Bits of Mars to Earth.
