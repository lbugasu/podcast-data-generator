As a result, Arizona became a hotbed of election misinformation and conspiracy theories, as false claims of a stolen election led to protests outside voting centers, a GOP-backed ballot audit and threats against election workers. Now, with just over 200 days until the 2024 election, experts warn that artificial intelligence could supercharge misinformation and disinformation in this year&#8217;s race. So how are election officials in a state that has already been in the trenches preparing for another battle over facts? In this episode of &#8220;Marketplace Tech\u2019s&#8221; limited series, &#8220;Decoding Democracy,&#8221; Lily Jamali and Kimberly Adams look back at what happened in Arizona during the last presidential election and how the state became entangled in conspiracy theories. Plus, we hear from Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes about how his office plans to combat AI-charged misinformation this year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

It stands for direct-recording electronic voting machines &#8230; the kind that record votes directly into a computer&#8217;s memory, often with no paper trail. In an effort to boost security and ensure more reliable counting of ballots across the country, officials have been replacing them with voting machines that produce a paper backup. And there has been noticeable progress on this front. According to a <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/costs-replacing-voting-equipment-2024\">recent report</a> from the nonprofit organization Verified Voting and the Brennan Center for Justice, in 2016 about 22% of registered voters were in jurisdictions that used DREs. By 2020, that figure had fallen to 9% and could drop considerably further this year. Marketplace&#8217;s Lily Jamali spoke with Megan Maier, co-author of the Verified Voting report, about replacing what&#8217;s left of these outdated machines and bringing that number down to zero.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

For decades, it was illegal under U.S. law to speak Native languages in schools. So in regard to learning them, generations of Indigenous children went without. Running Wolf grew up to become a computer scientist, landing a job working on Amazon&#8217;s virtual assistant, Alexa. A few years ago, he started to wonder how he might get something like Alexa to speak Cheyenne and other Indigenous languages. That has become his lifelong mission.</p>\n"

Earlier in its federal antitrust trial, Google said it paid Apple $18 billion a year to be the default search engine on iPhone web browsers. The government said that&#8217;s $18 billion worth of evidence of anticompetitive behavior. This week, a witness for Google accidentally disclosed the company was sharing 36% of ad revenue it made from Safari browser searches with Apple.

The country&#8217;s booming tech industry could be affected more than most, given that so many younger Israelis work in the sector.
