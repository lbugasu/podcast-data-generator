TikTok sued to block a bipartisan-backed law that will ban the Chinese-owned app in the U.S. by January 19 \u2014 unless it finds a U.S. buyer. This week, the government argued the app gives China access to Americans&#8217; sensitive data, as well as the ability to spread propaganda. While TikTok argued it&#8217;s been unfairly singled out and that a sale isn&#8217;t the only way to address security concerns. TikTok touts 170 million users in the U.S., and that includes both candidates for president. A group of U.S.-based creators have also joined as plaintiffs in this lawsuit.

TikTok sued to block a bipartisan-backed law that will ban the Chinese-owned app in the U.S. by January 19 \u2014 unless it finds a U.S. buyer. This week, the government argued the app gives China access to Americans&#8217; sensitive data, as well as the ability to spread propaganda. While TikTok argued it&#8217;s been unfairly singled out and that a sale isn&#8217;t the only way to address security concerns. TikTok touts 170 million users in the U.S., and that includes both candidates for president. A group of U.S.-based creators have also joined as plaintiffs in this lawsuit. Anupam Chander, professor of law and technology at Georgetown University, walked Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino through the arguments in the case.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",

Grok claims to avoid images that are pornographic, excessively violent or intended to deceive and added it&#8217;s cautious about representing content that might infringe on existing copyright.

And the outputs are a bit less censored than you might see with other similar tools. Experimenters online have been able to generate images of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris brandishing guns, Mickey Mouse smoking a cigarette and some far more disturbing tableaus. Grok claims to avoid images that are pornographic, excessively violent or intended to deceive and added it&#8217;s cautious about representing content that might infringe on existing copyright. But the guardrails certainly seem to be on the looser side, in keeping with owner Elon Musk&#8217;s hands-off approach to content moderation. Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Adi Robertson, senior tech and policy editor at the Verge, about Grok-2 and what she found while she tested the AI&#8217;s limits.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",

Since then, 14 states have outlawed abortions.\u00a0Still, some people in those states have been able to cut through barriers to get abortions via telehealth, according to a recent report from the research project #WeCount. Usually, this requires a virtual visit with a telehealth care provider. The provider assesses the patient and gets their information, then can mail them mifepristone and misoprostol, which aid in ending a pregnancy. The Supreme Court preserved access to mifepristone in a ruling this month, which means it can still be prescribed and mailed to patients. Marketplace&#8217;s Lily Jamali discussed the increase in telehealth abortions with Ushma Upadhyay, professor of OB-GYN and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, and a coauthor of the #WeCount report.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",

Since then, 14 states have outlawed abortions.\u00a0Still, some people in those states have been able to cut through barriers to get abortions via telehealth, according to a recent report from the research project #WeCount. Usually, this requires a virtual visit with a telehealth care provider. The provider assesses the patient and gets their information, then can mail them mifepristone and misoprostol, which aid in ending a pregnancy. The Supreme Court preserved access to mifepristone in a ruling this month, which means it can still be prescribed and mailed to patients. Marketplace&#8217;s Lily Jamali discussed the increase in telehealth abortions with Ushma Upadhyay, professor of OB-GYN and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, and a coauthor of the #WeCount report.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",

As a result, Arizona became a hotbed of election misinformation and conspiracy theories, as false claims of a stolen election led to protests outside voting centers, a GOP-backed ballot audit and threats against election workers. Now, with just over 200 days until the 2024 election, experts warn that artificial intelligence could supercharge misinformation and disinformation in this year&#8217;s race. So how are election officials in a state that has already been in the trenches preparing for another battle over facts? In this episode of &#8220;Marketplace Tech\u2019s&#8221; limited series, &#8220;Decoding Democracy,&#8221; Lily Jamali and Kimberly Adams look back at what happened in Arizona during the last presidential election and how the state became entangled in conspiracy theories. Plus, we hear from Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes about how his office plans to combat AI-charged misinformation this year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

As a result, Arizona became a hotbed of election misinformation and conspiracy theories, as false claims of a stolen election led to protests outside voting centers, a GOP-backed ballot audit and threats against election workers. Now, with just over 200 days until the 2024 election, experts warn that artificial intelligence could supercharge misinformation and disinformation in this year&#8217;s race. So how are election officials in a state that has already been in the trenches preparing for another battle over facts? In this episode of &#8220;Marketplace Tech\u2019s&#8221; limited series, &#8220;Decoding Democracy,&#8221; Lily Jamali and Kimberly Adams look back at what happened in Arizona during the last presidential election and how the state became entangled in conspiracy theories. Plus, we hear from Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes about how his office plans to combat AI-charged misinformation this year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

The destruction and death have been profound, and nearly every aspect of life in the roughly 140-square-mile territory has been upended. The New York Times recently reported that the Israeli military is using facial recognition artificial intelligence to monitor Palestinians in Gaza. The government hasn&#8217;t publicly acknowledged it, but reporter Sheera Frenkel spoke to Israeli intelligence officers, military officials and soldiers who confirmed that the technology was being used for mass surveillance. Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Frenkel about facial recognition&#8217;s role in the conflict, starting with the story of a Palestinian poet, Mosab Abu Toha, who reportedly was arrested and beaten by Israeli forces.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",
