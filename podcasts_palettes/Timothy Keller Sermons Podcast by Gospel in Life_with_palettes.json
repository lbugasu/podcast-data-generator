            "content": "<p>In 1 Kings 3, Solomon asks for wisdom. He asks for \u201ca heart that can discern right from wrong.\u201d The question is, \u201cIf he\u2019s the king of Israel, he has the law of God. Why would he need wisdom? Doesn\u2019t the Word of God tell you what\u2019s right and wrong?\u201d The reason is that it\u2019s not enough to just know the rules, but you need discernment from God for knowing what decision to make when the moral rules don\u2019t fit your situation perfectly.\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>Last week we saw one of the important ways to develop a heart of wisdom is to understand and manage the power of anger. This week we will see that in order to be wise, we need to understand and manage the power of sexuality. To do this, we have to know three things: 1) why and how we tend to undervalue sex; 2) why and how we tend, at the same time, to overvalue sex; and 3) how we can solve that.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 24, 2004.

There\u2019s a theological way to put it, and there\u2019s a more practical way to put it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>The theological problem is this: when you are saved, how do you move beyond being accepted by God as righteous to actually living a righteous life? This is a move from imputed righteousness to imparted righteousness. The more practical way is fairly simple. When you become a Christian, you realize you\u2019re forgiven and that God loves you, but you may continue to see sins in your life that continue to pop up. How do you move beyond that? How do you actually grow in the faith and become more like Christ? Paul gives us a radical answer: the way you enter the Christian faith is exactly the same way you advance in the Christian faith. We\u2019re going to dig deeper and look at this in more detail in today\u2019s sermon.\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 14, 1997.

This is a move from imputed righteousness to imparted righteousness. The more practical way is fairly simple. When you become a Christian, you realize you\u2019re forgiven and that God loves you, but you may continue to see sins in your life that continue to pop up. How do you move beyond that? How do you actually grow in the faith and become more like Christ? Paul gives us a radical answer: the way you enter the Christian faith is exactly the same way you advance in the Christian faith. We\u2019re going to dig deeper and look at this in more detail in today\u2019s sermon.\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 14, 1997. Series: Galatians: New Freedom, New Family. Scripture: Galatians 3:1-14.</p>\r\n\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

How did they receive the Spirit? How did this inner transformation happen? There are two things we\u2019ll discuss in this passage. One is the instrument of the Spirit, and the other is the secret of spiritual power.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 30, 1997. Series: Galatians: New Freedom, New Family. Scripture: Galatians 3:1-5.</p>\r\n\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

We saw that the problem was the message of a certain group of religious teachers.</p>\r\n\n<p>Their point was believing in Jesus Christ was very important; they weren\u2019t against Christ. But they said you have to add to Jesus Christ, his work, his love; faith and union with his work and his love is not enough to cleanse and beautify you. It\u2019s not enough. You have to believe in Christ, and, in their case, they said you have to adopt the entire Mosaic law, all the ceremonial laws. The important thing is the principle of the gospel: is Jesus Christ\u2019s work and love enough to cleanse and beautify you all by itself? Paul\u2019s answer is \u201cYes.\u201d For these folks the answer was \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 9, 1997. Series: Galatians: New Freedom, New Family. Scripture: Galatians 2:11-16.</p>\r\n\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

After living for centuries in a culture in which the cultural institutions supported their belief in God, they found themselves in Babylon, which was a religiously pluralistic society.

One wants to obey out of self-interest or out of fear. On the other hand, spiritual transformation consists of a deeper heart change. When the heart changes, then one\u2019s life, including actions and behavior, changes. In short, moral reformation happens by looking at rules; spiritual transformation happens by looking at Jesus (2 Corinthians 3:18).\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>We\u2019re going to look at Jesus in today\u2019s passage from Mark 14 when Jesus\u2019 disciples fall asleep. They were supposed to be keeping watch. Something utterly shocks Jesus and he says that it is his time to die. It comes upon him suddenly. There are three words that give us clues to what\u2019s happening in this passage: the cup, Abba, and began.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 10, 1998.

It\u2019s just beyond me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>This is the kind of situation that Jesus addresses in today\u2019s passage from John 16. \u00a0Jesus speaks to his disciples the night before he dies, right before he leaves them. In his last words to them, he maps out the kind of life he wants them to live and they are presumably overwhelmed. It\u2019s not something that they have to do alone though. Jesus says that he will send a counselor, which is the Holy Spirit. We\u2019re going to look at four things in regard to this counselor: the power, the goal, the method, and the results.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 19, 1998.

                "summary": "<p>One of the great questions of history is, \u201cWhy in the world did the early Christians adopt the cross as their main symbol?\u201d Do you realize why that is so odd? On the cross, Jesus died at age 33 in agony, abandoned by everyone in his life. All the other founders of religions died old and \u201csuccessful.\u201d For example, Buddha lived to be 80 years old and achieved enlightenment. And Muhammad lived into his 60s during which he united all of Arabia under one faith. There is a vivid contrast with the picture of Jesus. Why in the world would anyone look at Jesus dying on a cross and say, \u201cThat\u2019s the life I want to live. That\u2019s the one I want to follow. That\u2019s the faith for me\u201d?</p>\r\n\n<p>On the night before he died, Jesus gave his disciples the explanation of the meaning of his death in the upper room. When it was all over, they remembered it and they accepted it. It changed them. If you see what Jesus says to them and you take it in, it will change you too. There are four things which are life-changing about Jesus\u2019 death: 1) it is the center of history; 2) it is the foundation for a radically new, profoundly different community; 3) it is the solution to the great mystery; and 4) it is appropriated personally.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 6, 2003.

In this last part of the chapter, we\u2019re given the other side of being a disciple; instead of just being called messengers, we\u2019re also called to be neighbors. We\u2019re called to meet the needs of all the people around us, whether they believe the message or not. There are four things we learn: 1) it is required, 2) it has magnitude, 3) the motivation for doing it, and 4) how to do it.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 16, 2003.

                "summary": "<p>The last chapters of the book of Acts could all be called \u201cThe Sufferings of Paul,\u201d because it\u2019s just one bad thing happening to Paul after another. He is caught in a storm on his way to Rome. He has appealed to Rome and the soldiers have him in custody, and the sailors, of course, are running the boat.</p>\r\n\n<p>Now he\u2019s in a storm, and everyone is afraid for their lives. It says they had gone for days in this situation. Down in verse 20 it says, \u201cNeither sun nor stars appeared for many days. The storm continued raging. We finally gave up all hope of being saved.\u201d</p>\r\n\n<p>The storm, which was another part of Paul\u2019s suffering, represents all suffering. All the suffering we get in life could be called a storm. They\u2019re all like storms. Watching Paul deal with his storm teaches us something about how we can deal with all storms, all suffering, all troubles, when they come in. I would like you to notice the paradox, the purpose, and the presence in storms.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Rev. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on June 23, 2013.

But I think it\u2019s helpful to look at this from a different angle because it\u2019s actually addressed to Christians. There are many speeches and sermons in Acts, but this is the only place where we actually have a sustained address given to Christians about how they should be the church.</p>\r\n\n<p>We\u2019re going to study this under four headings: truth, tears, ties, and not missing the forest for the trees.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Rev.

If you want to learn about the topic of suffering, you go to the book of Job or a lot of other places in the Bible that seem to deal with it more directly. But this passage is actually a lot about suffering.\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>This miracle, in many ways, is typical of so many of the other miracles of the New Testament done by Jesus or by apostles. If you understand this one, in some ways you\u2019ll be able to understand all of the miracles in the New Testament. We\u2019re going to see that it points 1) upward, 2) forward, 3) inward, and 4) downward. This is the grid for us to learn about suffering and to see the meaning of New Testament miracles.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Rev.

                "summary": "<p>We\u2019ve been going through the book of Matthew looking at the big blocks of teaching Jesus gives his disciples for how he wants his followers to live. While the Sermon on the Mount was mainly about how Christian disciples would relate to each other, starting with this passage, Jesus turns around and says, \u201cBut now here\u2019s how I want my disciples to relate to the world.\u201d\u00a0</p>\r\n\n<p>This passage was Jesus teaching on how to move into a new town or a new neighborhood or a new city as Christian disciples and begin to do mission, begin to do Christian ministry. The whole passage is about, first of all, how we are to share the compassion of Jesus (verses 5\u201315); secondly, how we are to share the offense of Jesus (verses 16\u201323); and thirdly, where we are to get the power to do that (verses 24 and 25).</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Rev. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on July 1, 2012. Series \"Savior and Teacher - A Study of Matthew\r\n\". Scripture: Matthew 10:5-25.</p>\r\n\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
