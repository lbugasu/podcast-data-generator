David sends his men to ask Nabal for food and drink, as is customary when a guest visits. Nabal is a proud and arrogant man, and he refuses to give David anything. He insults David and his men, calling them \"worthless rabble.\" Abigail, Nabal's wise and resourceful wife, learns of her husband's behavior and takes matters into her own hands. She gathers a large amount of food and drink and sets out to meet David. Abigail arrives at David's camp and falls on her face before him. She apologizes for her husband's behavior and begs David not to take revenge. David is impressed by Abigail's wisdom and humility, and he agrees to spare Nabal's life. The next day, Nabal learns of what has happened. He is so ashamed that he has a stroke and dies ten days later. David marries Abigail and she becomes a wise and supportive wife to him."

Samuel opposes the idea, interpreting the request as a rejection of his own leadership. God has an equally negative view of the request, but informs Samuel that the people have actually rejected Himself, not the prophet, in making the request. Nevertheless, God tells Samuel to anoint Saul in response (1 Sam 9, 10). In the previous episode of the podcast, we talked about how Scripture outside 1 Samuel 8-10 articulates a positive view of kingship, even marrying it to the messianic vision. In this episode we discuss how this perspective dovetails with the selection of Saul.\n\nOUR SPONSOR: LOGOS.COM/NAKEDBIBLE"

Listen as we propose a different explanation, one that dovetails beautifully with the Deuteronomy 32 worldview articulated in Dr. Heiser\u2019s The Unseen Realm and Demons books."

The chapter describes a \u201cmighty angel\u201d who holds a scroll that the awestruck John will take from his hand and eat. This odd language has Old Testament precedent in Ezekiel. However, it is the angel that has drawn the most attention from scholars. This angel is simultaneously described with phrases that have occurred earlier in the book\u2014in descriptions of God and Jesus. Is this confusion on John\u2019s part, or a theological contradiction? This episode addresses those questions."

Nevertheless, many Gentile believers today wonder whether their love for Yeshua (Jesus) and faithfulness as his followers ought to be expressed by observing the Law. What of Jewish believers in Jesus? Does Acts 15 assume that Jewish believers in Yeshua must be Torah observant? Did not Jesus and Paul teach believers to \u201cdo and observe\u201d the Law? What about New Testament passages that suggest believers are not under the Law, and that the Law became obsolete with the making of the new covenant (Heb. 8: 6\u2013 13)? Dr. Seth Postell joins us today to answer these and other questions. The conversation focuses on his important (and highly recommended) book, Reading Moses, Seeing Jesus: How the Torah Fulfills its Goal in Yeshua (co-authored with Eitan Bar and Erez Soref). His thesis is straightforward: The purpose of the Torah, Genesis through Deuteronomy, is that it is an historical narrative whose purpose is to lead Israel through the broken Law and beyond, namely, to Yeshua, the Messiah. Dr. Postell is a key leader at <a href=\"https://www.oneforisrael.org/\">One for Israel</a>, a multi-faceted non-profit ministry with the express goal of reaching Israelis and Arabs with the good news of Yeshua.

Dr. Swamidass is an M.D. and Ph.D. research scientist. His recent book, published by InterVarsity Press, is entitled, The Genealogical Adam and Eve: The Surprising Science of Universal Ancestry. Contrary to other Christian biologists, whose research in the last twenty years has led some apologetics ministries to deny the historicity of Adam and Eve, Dr. Swamidass argues that a historical Adam and Eve is quite possible and not in conflict with genetic science.

In this episode of the podcast, we chat with Dr. John Hilber about the obstacle and its solution, both of which received sustained attention in his new book, Old Testament Cosmology and Divine Accommodation: A Relevance Theory Approach (Wipf and Stock, 2020).\nListeners can get Dr. Hilber\u2019s book for 40% off only by going to the Wipf and Stock website and applying the coupon code DIVINE at checkout. **Offer valid November 1st-30th, 2020**",

In this episode we chat with Dr. David de Silva, a recognized expert in this area of Second Temple period / New Testament study. As he wrote in The Dictionary of New Testament Background, \u201cHonor refers to the public acknowledgment of a person\u2019s worth, granted on the basis of how fully that individual embodies qualities and behaviors valued by the group. First-century Mediterranean people were oriented from early childhood to seek honor and avoid disgrace, meaning that they would be sensitive to public recognition or reproach. Where different cultures with different values existed side by side, it became extremely important to insulate one\u2019s own group members against the desire for honor or avoidance of dishonor in the eyes of outsiders, since only by so doing could one remain wholly committed to the distinctive culture and values of the group. This struggle is particularly evident in the NT, as church leaders seek to affirm the honor of Christians on the basis of their adherence to Jesus while insulating them from the disapproval they face from non-Christian Jews and Gentiles alike.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">David A. deSilva, \u201cHonor and Shame,\u201d Dictionary of New Testament Background: A Compendium of Contemporary Biblical Scholarship (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2000), 518\u2013519.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Important Resources:</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David de Silva,\u00a0<em>Honor, Patronage, Kinship, and Purity: Unlocking New Testament Culture\u00a0</em>(IVP Academic, 2000)</p>\n<p>David de Silva,\u00a0<em>Introducing the Apocrypha: Message, Context, and Significance\u00a0</em>(Baker Academic, 2018)</p>\n<p>David de Silva,\u00a0<em>The Letter to the Galatians (New International Commentary on the New Testament</em>\u00a0(NICNT; 2018)</p>",

First-century Mediterranean people were oriented from early childhood to seek honor and avoid disgrace, meaning that they would be sensitive to public recognition or reproach. Where different cultures with different values existed side by side, it became extremely important to insulate one\u2019s own group members against the desire for honor or avoidance of dishonor in the eyes of outsiders, since only by so doing could one remain wholly committed to the distinctive culture and values of the group. This struggle is particularly evident in the NT, as church leaders seek to affirm the honor of Christians on the basis of their adherence to Jesus while insulating them from the disapproval they face from non-Christian Jews and Gentiles alike.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">David A. deSilva, \u201cHonor and Shame,\u201d Dictionary of New Testament Background: A Compendium of Contemporary Biblical Scholarship (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2000), 518\u2013519.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Important Resources:</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David de Silva,\u00a0<em>Honor, Patronage, Kinship, and Purity: Unlocking New Testament Culture\u00a0</em>(IVP Academic, 2000)</p>\n<p>David de Silva,\u00a0<em>Introducing the Apocrypha: Message, Context, and Significance\u00a0</em>(Baker Academic, 2018)</p>\n<p>David de Silva,\u00a0<em>The Letter to the Galatians (New International Commentary on the New Testament</em>\u00a0(NICNT; 2018)</p>",

In the first four verses Paul takes on the false teaching, circulating in the Thessalonian church, that the Day of the Lord had already come to pass. In the process Paul tells the believers \u201cLet no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the apostasia comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction.\u201d It\u2019s clear that the man of lawlessness is the antichrist, but what is the apostasia? Some translations render the Greek term \u201cfalling away,\u201d but others have \u201crebellion\u201d? Just what event is Paul talking that must occur before the revealing of the antichrist? Later in the chapter Paul mentions an impersonal \u201crestraint\u201d and a mysterious figure who is the \u201crestrainer\u201d that are holding back the events leading to the second coming. What or who could do that? This episode tackles both these difficulties."

The renewal of the covenant at Shechem, the miraculous crossing of the Jordan with the Ark of the Covenant, Joshua\u2019s encounter with the supernatural commander of the Lord\u2019s host, the sending of the spies to the city and their reception by Rahab, the weird battle instructions to march around the city and blow the ram\u2019s horns, and the collapse of the walls have been retold in countless Sunday School classes and sermons. But virtually unknown is that many of these details have correspondences in a story from Ugarit, an ancient city state in Syria. That story is known as the Keret (or Kirta) Epic. In this episode we talk about the similarities and how an ancient reader might have processed such parallels."

Included in those sacrifices were 70 bulls, a number that far exceeds any other Israelites festival. Scholars have taken note of the number and speculated that it has some relationship to the number of the sons of God allotted to the nations in the judgment at Babel (Deut 32:8-9; cp.

Scholars have attempted to explain this passage in many ways. Some have suggested that Jesus was speaking figuratively, not speaking of buying literal swords, but alluding to the future persecution of the disciples. Some suggest Jesus was preparing them to take up swords to defend themselves after his departure, preparing them for bandits along the way. Along these lines, still others suggest Jesus was referring more generally to the time of trial to come after his resurrection. This passage has even featured prominently in modern debates regarding Christian positions on guns and violence, some evangelical voices going as far to suggest that Jesus by implication encourages the right to brandish and use fire arms.

Why did the Old Testament individuals listed in Hebrews 11 \u201cmake the cut\u201d? Was there something extraordinary about them? This episode explores the relationship of this famous passage to its far less famous context: Heb 10:35-39. Those in the \u201chall of faith\u201d are not there because they were shining examples of moral purity, or because they never had doubts about what God was doing, or because they weren\u2019t tested. Rather, they are there because they all held fast to faith\u2014they did not \u201cshrink back\u201d from their believing loyalty in what God had promised. Hebrews 11 illustrates that we must have faith in what God has done for us, not our performance."

            "content": "<p>What is the New Apostolic Reformation, with Holly Pivec</p>\n<p>The New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) seems to quite clearly justify labeling it a movement or denomination. Millions of people around the world are part of its network of churches. However, many NAR leaders and advocates deny that it\u2019s a denomination or movement. Many Christians who are attracted by NAR teachings and practices have no idea that something called the NAR even exists. For those aware of its influence and presence within Christianity, the NAR has branded itself as representing the return of authoritative apostles and prophets to the modern church, complete with miracles such as healing and raising the dead.

Since the \u201cinheritance\u201d language of Heb 1:1-4 cannot suggest that God himself is being retired and succeeded, the language needs to be understood in terms of co-rulership.

Doing so observes the way Ezekiel re-purposes cosmic mountain imagery and Leviticus 25 in these chapters and produces fascinating conceptual and theological connections between the temple vision and Jesus, his atonement, and believers as members of his body.\nSources\nJon D.

It also addresses the fallacies of translating Hebrew nesi\u02be ro\u02besh as \u201cprince of Rosh\u201d and interpreting the phrase as modern-day Russia, and the difficulties ancient translators had with the term. An alternative understanding of Gog is offered, one that is consistent with the supernaturalistic worldview of the \u201cfoe from the north\u201d motif in Old Testament thought.\nResources\nGreece Anatolia Russia Map\nPaul Tanner, \u201cDaniel\u2019s \u2018King of the North\u2019: Do We Owe Russia an Apology?\u201d Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 35:3 [Sept 1992]: 315-328 (see esp. 322-326 for the evangelical dispensational predilection for an identification with Russia).

                "summary": "The book we know as 1 Enoch was well known to early Christians. Its importance produced an understandable question among some influential early Christian writers and, one may presume, Christians in general: Should 1 Enoch be considered inspired and thus \u201cScripture\u201d in the manner of other books in the Old Testament? Ultimately, Christianity at large answered this question negatively, save for the Church in Ethiopia. But the discussion is nonetheless of interest today. This episode presents an abbreviated survey of how select Second Temple Jews and early Christian books and writers assessed the scriptural status of 1 Enoch.\nGoogle Book referenced:\nJames C.

The topic for this episode is the controversial head covering reference in 1 Cor. 11:13-15. The discussion summarizes the material discussed in a scholarly journal article published in 2004 by Dr. Troy Martin entitled, \u201cPaul&#8217;s Argument from Nature for the Veil in 1 Cor. 11:13-15: A Testicle instead of a Head Covering&#8221; (Journal of Biblical Literature 123:1 [2004]: 75-84). Martin summarizes his approach as follows: \u201cThis article interprets Paul&#8217;s argument from nature in 1 Cor. 11:13-15 against the background of ancient physiology. The Greek and Roman medical texts provide useful information for interpreting not only Paul&#8217;s letters but also other NT texts.\u201d The article (and the author\u2019s subsequent responses to criticism, also published in academic literature) presents a compelling case and is, to Dr. Heiser\u2019s knowledge, the only approach that provides a coherent explanation as to why the head covering warnings are important, in the words of Paul \u201cbecause of the angels\u201d (1 Cor. 11:10). This warning ultimately takes readers back to the incident with the Watchers (sons of God) in Gen. 6:1-4. One of Martin&#8217;s concluding application thoughts is also important: &#8220;Since the physiological conceptions of the body have changed, however, no physiological reason remains for continuing the practice of covering women&#8217;s heads in public worship, and many Christian communities reasonably abandon this practice.&#8221; In other words, Paul&#8217;s rationale for what he says here is no longer coherent today &#8212; but his teaching points are (modesty, sexual fidelity).

In this episode and the next, I want to recommend the best books and reference sources for understanding the religion and culture of the ANE and Second Temple period. Scholars who are steeped in this material have produced many essays explaining the worldview of these civilizations and how that worldview matters for biblical study and interpretation. My goal is to direct you to the best of those resources. As is our pattern, we\u2019ll devote this episode to the ANE, the context for the OT, before moving to the Second Temple period, the context for the NT, in the next episode of the

            "content": "<p>In this second episode of the series on Bible study, Dr. Heiser discusses what interpreting the Bible &#8220;in context&#8221; really means &#8212; taking the Bible&#8217;s own primitive context seriously. Rather than filter the Bible through creeds dating from the 17th and 18th centuries, or even the period of early Christianity, the Bible&#8217;s actual context is the one that produced the biblical books &#8212; the era stretching from the 2nd millennium BC to the first century AD. All other contexts are foreign to the Bible, no matter how persuasive they are in denominational traditions. The student of the Bible must make all foreign contexts subservient to the Bible&#8217;s own context. That means replacing our own worldview with that of the biblical writer living during this ancient time span in the ancient Near East and eastern Mediterranean. The way to do that is to immerse ourselves in the intellectual output of those cultures in which the biblical Israelite and later Hellenistic Jews lived when God moved them to write Scripture. The episode ends with suggestions about resources\u00a0for familiarizing oneself with the literature of all these cultures.

I think it would be difficult to find anyone who has spent any time in a Christian church of any denomination who has not heard of the Lord\u2019s Supper, also known as communion or the Lord\u2019s Table. But while most listeners will have heard of the doctrine before, I\u2019m willing to bet few have really thought about or, perhaps stated more precisely, have ever questioned what they\u2019ve been taught about it in light of their own reading of the Scriptures. As familiar as you might think it is, I\u2019m convinced that this doctrine is one of the least critically examined of all biblical doctrines.
