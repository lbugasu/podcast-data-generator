    "description": "<p>Burnout: You\u2019ve read about it. You\u2019ve heard about it. Heck, you\u2019re probably living it. And you\u2019ve probably tried everything to fix it. Levels of burnout are reaching new all-time highs, every single day. And the pandemic has only made things worse. This new series, hosted by Connor Franta, looks into how society reached a burning point and what we can do - really, actually do - to break the cycle. With his signature wit and charm, Connor explores the story of burnout, discovers how it affects your body and mind, and looks at why the easy solutions simply won\u2019t work to solve a systemic problem. From Lemonada and Mindful.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

Levels of burnout are reaching new all-time highs, every single day. And the pandemic has only made things worse. This new series, hosted by Connor Franta, looks into how society reached a burning point and what we can do - really, actually do - to break the cycle. With his signature wit and charm, Connor explores the story of burnout, discovers how it affects your body and mind, and looks at why the easy solutions simply won\u2019t work to solve a systemic problem. From Lemonada and Mindful."
