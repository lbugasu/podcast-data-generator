Created by journalist and former WQXR Creative Director Clemency Burton-Hill, each episode offers a brief and soulful glimpse into human lives, helping us to hear this music \u2014 and each other \u2014 differently. Guests from the worlds of film, books, dance, comedy and fashion as well as firefighters, taxi drivers, and teachers share cherished musical memories and remind us that extraordinary things happen when we simply stop and listen. \n\nTranscripts are posted to individual episode pages as they become available.  \n\nThe Open Ears Project is produced by WQXR and WNYC Studios.",

Created by journalist and former WQXR Creative Director Clemency Burton-Hill, each episode offers a brief and soulful glimpse into human lives, helping us to hear this music \u2014 and each other \u2014 differently. Guests from the worlds of film, books, dance, comedy and fashion as well as firefighters, taxi drivers, and teachers share cherished musical memories and remind us that extraordinary things happen when we simply stop and listen. \n\nTranscripts are posted to individual episode pages as they become available.  \n\nThe Open Ears Project is produced by WQXR and WNYC Studios."
