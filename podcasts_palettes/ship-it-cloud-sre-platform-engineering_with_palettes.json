                    "description": "In our ops & infra world, we learn to optimise for redundancy, for mean time to recovery and for graceful degradation. We instinctively recognise single points of failure, and try to mitigate the risks associated with them.\n\nFor some years now, Daniel Vassallo has been doing the same, but in the context of life & work. Daniel talks about the role of randomness, about learning from small wins & about optimising for a lifestyle that matches your true preferences. Apparently, ideas too should be treated like cattle, not pets.",

Let's Deploy Straight to Production!\n\nSo how do we create an Internal Development Platform that enables anyone on the team to deploy straight to production with the confidence that everything will just work?",

                    "description": "Today we are talking with Maikel Vlasman, technical lead for a large Dutch machine construction company, and a cloud engineer by heart. We cover self-updating GitLab & ArgoCD, Maikel's thinking behind dev environment setup and a Kubernetes workshop that he is preparing for his team. The goal is to function as a true DevOps team with shared responsibilities. \n\nThis conversation started as a thread in our community Slack - link in the show notes. Thank you Maikel for being a long-time Changelog listener and for reaching out to us - we enjoyed telling this story.",

                    "description": "In this episode we talk about launching Dagger with all four founders: Andrea, Eric, Sam & Solomon. \n\nWhile you may remember Sam & Solomon from episode 23, this time we assembled all four superheroes in this story and went deeper, covering nearly three years of refinements, the launch, as well as the world-class team & community that is coming together to solve the next problem of shipping software. Container images and Kubernetes are great steps in the right direction, but now it's time for the next leap into the future.\n\nYou can use Dagger to run your CI/CD pipelines locally, without needing to commit and push. You can also use Dagger as a Makefile alternative, which resonates with Gerhard, but go further and your perspective on documentation & automation may start shifting.\n\nGerhard believes that this is the Docker moment of CI/CD.",

He is talking with Drew Marshall, director at Trunk Networks and No One Internet, a Cloud Services Provider &amp; ISP based in Sussex, UK.</p>\n<p>Gerhard\u2019s Vodafone ISP gateway was losing packets, and recording some of the previous episodes used to be challenging as his internet connection would cut out up to 10 seconds at a time, multiple times per recording session. He was convinced that his Unifi Dream Machine Pro was not the issue. Drew helped Gerhard realise that it actually was. Not only has Gerhard\u2019s DNS latency improved by 3x, but he can now fail-over between two WAN connections. And because nothing beats a real-world experiment, you can guess what is coming in this episode \ud83d\ude09</p>\n<p>You will find latency &amp; packet loss graphs, speed test runs, and a few other interestings in the show notes. We hope that they inspire you to setup a better home network.

                    "description": "Today Gerhard shares the entire story behind his lost packets. He is talking with Drew Marshall, director at Trunk Networks and No One Internet, a Cloud Services Provider & ISP based in Sussex, UK.\n\nGerhard's Vodafone ISP gateway was losing packets, and recording some of the previous episodes used to be challenging as his internet connection would cut out up to 10 seconds at a time, multiple times per recording session. He was convinced that his Unifi Dream Machine Pro was not the issue. Drew helped Gerhard realise that it actually was. Not only has Gerhard's DNS latency improved by 3x, but he can now fail-over between two WAN connections. And because nothing beats a real-world experiment, you can guess what is coming in this episode \ud83d\ude09\n\nYou will find latency & packet loss graphs, speed test runs, and a few other interestings in the show notes. We hope that they inspire you to setup a better home network. Most importantly, may you find your humble & brilliant Drew.",

                    "description": "Merry Shipmas! This is our special Christmas episode which sums up two months of very early mornings and a few late nights. After many twists and turns, stuff which didn't work out, as well as pleasant surprises, this is what we ended up with:\n* \ud83c\udf81 PR #395 - CI/CD Lego set with Guillaume de Rouville & Joel Longtine\n* \ud83c\udf81 PR #396 - Continuous CPU profiling with Frederic Branczyk\n* \ud83c\udf81 PR #399 - Auto-restoring Kubernetes clusters with Dan Mangum & Muvaffak Onu\u015f\n\nWhile we initially intended to have five Christmas presents in total, only three got delivered in time. We planned, worked hard and eventually shipped the best we could just in time for this special Christmas episode. Our hope is that the latest additions to our changelog.com GitHub repository will help you just as much as they will help our 2022 setup.\n\n\ud83c\udf84Merry Shipmas everyone! \ud83c\udf84\n",

                    "description": "Tammer Saleh, founder of SuperOrbital and former VP of Engineering at Pivotal, is joining Gerhard to talk about table tennis, remote work, and challenges that teams have with K8s.\n\nSome years ago, both Tammer & Gerhard used to work in the same London office on CloudFoundry, and nowadays they are both into Kubernetes. Tammer and the SuperOrbital team are deeply experienced in this topic, and they help teams at companies like Bloomberg, Shopify, and federal U.S. agencies tackle hard Kubernetes and DevOps problems through engineering and training.\n\nWhy do companies need Kubernetes in the first place? Which are the right reasons for choosing it? Is Kubernetes a platform? Gerhard's favourite: we are doing Kubernetes wrong, but it works better than when we were doing it right, so what's up with that? This last one was a lot of fun, and we left the entire minute of laughter in at your request. Enjoy!",

                    "description": "This is our second Kaizen episode, where Adam, Jerod & Gerhard talk about changelog.com improvements since episode 10. OK, so Gerhard deleted the DNS API token. Not only did he take the time to understand how that happened, so that he could actually learn from his mistake, but now we have a system in place so that we can share learnings from incidents. By the way, these are publicly available in our #incidents Slack channel.\n\nA great & unexpected thing that happened since we recorded this episode, is Jerod fixing 99% of all the errors that were happening in prod. The top error was the broken Twitter auth - sorry Matt - which was a result of us upgrading to OTP 24 a few months back. Episode 3 show notes include a YouTube stream which captures it all.\n\nWe wrap up this episode by each of us sharing the improvements that we would like to do until our next Kaizen. You heard it from Adam first: **Ship It Driven Development**",

                    "description": "In this episode, Gerhard talks to his Skyhook Adventure friends: Alan Cooney, Saul Cullen & Wycliffe Maina. They are the ones that introduced Gerhard to the world of serverless in the context of Amazon Web Services. Gerhard shared his experience with remote work, how to ship software with confidence and consistency, and what to look for in infrastructure as code. \n\nAt the heart of Skyhook Adventure are adventure trips, and 2020 was not a good one for this business. As you can already tell, code and infrastructure was not the biggest challenge for this team. Having said that, serverless, microservices, a monorepo and the event-based architecture played a big part in successfully navigating the challenges.\n\nThis is a story about what happens when a good team allows itself to be guided by solid experience and keeps doing the right thing, long-term. It's fun, real, and it applies to many.",

How do you build & ship an app in a Cloud Native way? Katie Gamanji, Ecosystem Advocate @ CNCF and former cloud engineer for American Express, Cond\u00e9 Nast and Microsoft, joins Gerhard to cover these topics in the context of the Cloud Native Fundamentals course that she developed. 15,000 students have already enrolled, and the initial feedback has been great. Tune in if you want to know why you should too, how to do it and when the course will become available for free.",
