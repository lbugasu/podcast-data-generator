    "description": "The 11th is a podcast that publishes an entirely new issue on the 11th of every month. Inspired by the experience of opening a magazine you love every month and not knowing exactly what you will get, but trusting that something engaging and true will be there waiting for you. Many stories aren’t meant to be a 10-part series and don’t fit the format of a weekly show. The 11th is a home for those in-between ideas. Made up of reported series and personal journeys, fiction and musicals, deep investigative journalism and intimate conversations. Each issue, a different voice. Every month, something new.\n\nThis month: For 30 years The Landmark Forum has offered promises of profound personal breakthroughs. Millions of people have paid this organization hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars in hopes of getting a rapid transformation. Some say that what takes years of therapy to do… this program can do in a weekend.  Their method sounds appealingly simple - they put you in a room with somewhere around 150 strangers for three days — and then push your psychological boundaries until you break down and share your most intimate secrets, fears, and desires. Host and filmmaker, Kelly Loudenberg, asks why millions of people have flocked to spend their weekend in a beige hotel ballroom and divulge their deepest secrets and insecurities with hundreds of strangers.",

        "summary": "The 11th is a podcast that publishes an entirely new issue on the 11th of every month. Inspired by the experience of opening a magazine you love every month and not knowing exactly what you will get, but trusting that something engaging and true will be there waiting for you. Many stories aren’t meant to be a 10-part series and don’t fit the format of a weekly show. The 11th is a home for those in-between ideas. Made up of reported series and personal journeys, fiction and musicals, deep investigative journalism and intimate conversations. Each issue, a different voice. Every month, something new.\n\nThis month: For 30 years The Landmark Forum has offered promises of profound personal breakthroughs. Millions of people have paid this organization hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars in hopes of getting a rapid transformation. Some say that what takes years of therapy to do… this program can do in a weekend.  Their method sounds appealingly simple - they put you in a room with somewhere around 150 strangers for three days — and then push your psychological boundaries until you break down and share your most intimate secrets, fears, and desires. Host and filmmaker, Kelly Loudenberg, asks why millions of people have flocked to spend their weekend in a beige hotel ballroom and divulge their deepest secrets and insecurities with hundreds of strangers."
