I come from a research background, and now doing an engineering job at a B2B SaaS company is leaving me wanting a change. Moving between teams is not an option, so I plan to move companies early next year. My problem is that I don’t know whether to look for another large or mid-size company (I’m finishing final rounds at Facebook and Palantir), or go to a startup where it is likely to be more interesting (I have an offer to be the lead engineer at a very small startup, where there are already 5 developers). I have one year of industry experience. If I go to the startup, will it negatively impact my career in the future if/when I want to move elsewhere? Would it be easier to move elsewhere, and get a better offer or a higher position, if I work at Facebook or Palantir instead of this startup? Also, while I prefer research, I’m not in the position to go back to grad school and finish my PhD (I finished my MS and left to work) for monetary reasons, so I need to move to another engineering position.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>I’ve often heard of senior employees “negotiating their exit” instead of resigning/quitting, with rumors of large negotiated payouts. I assume that’s just a select group of people who can, but I’ve never seen much written on that. What is the situation where you can do this?

For my one on ones, we have a long running list of things we talk about and even the trail there doesn’t seem to amount to anything.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>How do I hold my manager accountable for things they say or plan to do? How do I bring up these conversation on one-on-ones without making it seem like I’m the one managing them?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

This is maybe the opposite of a problem, but I’ve found myself stuck - how do you navigate too much interest from outside parties? I work in a pretty niche subsection of software dev, so I field a lot of job offers/recruitment when people start to put together a new team. These are usually coming from managers/people I would be working with directly (and admire!) rather than recruiters. Generally the opportunities are something I could see myself doing <em>one day</em>, but I’m perfectly content in my role as-is for the time being. Where’s the line between expressing interest in future opportunities (emphasis on future) without stringing people along? How many “catch up” conversations are reasonable before it shifts from maintaining a relationship to active recruiting? Apologies if this comes across as a humble brag but I’m getting overwhelmed. Love the show, you rock 🤘</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>I recently started a new position at a startup after being recruited by one of their senior leaders. Being a startup the company has had its ups and downs, including some layoffs within the last year. I am really loving the company so far, the people, the culture. They really seem to care about correcting past mistakes and listening to feedback from everyone. There is still a good amount of turnover among engineers and engineering managers. I’m sure some turnover is normal especially at startup. But at what point does it really become something I need to be concerned about? What questions should/can I ask to help me get a better picture of what is going on? Is there anything specific I should look out for that might be my cue to start creating a backup plan?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n",

I work in a pretty niche subsection of software dev, so I field a lot of job offers/recruitment when people start to put together a new team. These are usually coming from managers/people I would be working with directly (and admire!) rather than recruiters. Generally the opportunities are something I could see myself doing one day, but I’m perfectly content in my role as-is for the time being. Where’s the line between expressing interest in future opportunities (emphasis on future) without stringing people along? How many “catch up” conversations are reasonable before it shifts from maintaining a relationship to active recruiting? Apologies if this comes across as a humble brag but I’m getting overwhelmed. Love the show, you rock 🤘\n\r\n  \n\r\n  \n\r\n    \nI recently started a new position at a startup after being recruited by one of their senior leaders. Being a startup the company has had its ups and downs, including some layoffs within the last year. I am really loving the company so far, the people, the culture. They really seem to care about correcting past mistakes and listening to feedback from everyone. There is still a good amount of turnover among engineers and engineering managers. I’m sure some turnover is normal especially at startup. But at what point does it really become something I need to be concerned about? What questions should/can I ask to help me get a better picture of what is going on? Is there anything specific I should look out for that might be my cue to start creating a backup plan?",

Wanting to develop in my career, and knowing you have advised others in the past to move on from their first job out of uni. What is your opinion of seeking out and switching jobs into remote work? Will this provide the same development value found in a traditional job switch, especially after the impact COVID has had on the way companies see remote work.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

While I didn’t hide it on the interview process It’s not something I advertise at all but I got to a point where I just don’t know what to do about it. And so that would be my question: What would you advice for someone in my position?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>I’m working at a small company where we used to have 2 developers. Both of us had at least 10 years of professional experience and both of us are around 28 years old. A few months ago, our bosses decided to hire 3 new FE devs and all of them come from bootcamp.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>That wouldn’t be so unusual, but all of them are 35+ years old and have families and basically just 6 months of experience. This causes a lot of friction in our team. We’re trying to “mentor” them in best practices and experience we’ve gained over time, but sometimes they don’t accept it, because we’re just too young for them (in one case 10 years younger).</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Do you have any tips how to approach “mentorship” when it comes from younger to older dev? And how to overcome the 10 year barrier?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"show-notes\">Show Notes</h2>\r\n<p>https://www.simscale.com/blog/2017/12/nasa-mars-climate-orbiter-metric/</p>\r\n\r\n<p>https://money.cnn.com/2012/05/13/technology/yahoo-ceo-out/index.htm</p>\r\n"

I’d rather have clean, predictable code that doesn’t break in production.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>How do I get my team to buy off on these principles?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Hi Dave and Jamison</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>How do I communicate all of the self-study that I’ve done to potential employers?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I transitioned from a bachelor’s degree in the health sciences to the software industry and I have now worked as a data scientist for a couple of years. I spent a lot of time and effort taking free online classes in mathematics and computer science through Stanford and MIT. Over 3 years I’ve probably done the equivalent of half of a math degree and about a third of a full CS curriculum. And even though I’m employed now, I still keep working on more advanced classes in my spare time.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>How can I communicate this to potential employers considering that I’m not getting any academic credits for my effort? Should I just leave this off my resume? Is it okay to mention that I have audited those classes? Any other ideas?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Thanks for the lovely podcast.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

It’s an amazing company, 5 minutes from where I live, with a really good culture. I have an awesome role as a senior developer working with interesting new technologies, a lot of flexibility, responsibilities and a valued opinion on both technological and company-wide matters. However, this is still my first job.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I’ve invested a lot of time and effort on career growth the last few years but I feel like there are only a few developers at my company who share the same level of enthusiasm and the need to grow as I do. I’ve been able to bring in new tech, introduce modern practices and share knowledge with my colleagues, but it feels like I’m the only one who’s actively pushing for this.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Since this is my first job, I don’t know if this is the case in other places as well. I’ve done some freelance projects on the side to learn more about how things work somewhere else  but mostly I’m the only senior dev on these projects.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>On the one hand I have a job that I love, on the other hand I don’t really know what’s out there. I feel like I might regret it later if I don’t try something else but based on other people’s experiences, I know it’s hard to find a company with such a good culture and understanding as where I am right now. Switching jobs would also give me a significant salary increase, but will require a longer commute. There are only a few software companies in my area.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Can you help me figure out if I should take the blue pill or the red pill?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n",

When being asked for expected salary. I mentioned a number lot more than what the company was expecting. It’s already been a week and I haven’t received a response from them. I really really love the company and the project they are working on. I would love to to contact the HR personal and tell that I am interested in the position even if it means less money. How do I approach the situation? I don’t want to mess it up more than I already have. 🙁</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

When I was considering joining, I said it was important for me to feel ethically aligned with my work, and asked about how things had changed since The Incident. They told me they stopped doing bad things, and I accepted the offer. Well, during my time at the company, it has slowly been dawning on me that my team is THE TEAM in question. I finally gathered the courage to ask a coworker, and he confirmed that this was true, and that there’s more designs coming down the pipeline that he and other devs are uncomfortable building. He brought it up with our manager and he was basically told “business is business”. As devs, we don’t make the decisions. And our golden handcuffs are really shiny. Should I leave, stay and try to influence change from the inside, or stay and maybe be a whistleblower one day if need be?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>I think I made a horrible mistake. I gave up an undesirable job for a fairly large tech company, and joined a Drupal agency. These two weeks have been the longest year of my life. I haven’t written one line of code, and the Drupal admin is incomprehensible. Since it’s only been a (relatively) short time here, how do I get back in the job market without looking like a chump? Do I remove it from my resume? Do I own it like a hideous tattoo? What do I tell hiring managers; whether its a gap in my resume, or that I want to leave after only 2 weeks?

I could potentially escalate the issue to the manager of our team but I basically see working with this individual as toxic and the PM as autopiloting to the finish line.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"show-notes\">Show Notes</h2>\r\n<p>https://www.computerworld.com/article/2534312/the–640k–quote-won-t-go-away—-but-did-gates-really-say-it-.html - apparently the bill gates quote is apocryphal</p>\r\n"

Which is great, because I like well-defined processes. And I followed those processes happily.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Now, there are some occasions where the senior engineer violates one of the processes.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When they do that I ask why, then they give me the reason and I nod because I think that make sense.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fast forward a little, and I also choose to violate the process the same way, for the same reasons.

He has learned things at a reasonable speed but it is still hard for him to implement new features without any help or existing code to copy.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In past jobs, I usually gave juniors simple, easy tasks, but we don’t have that simple tasks in my current job because we’re working on complicated internal systems.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Also other junior developers spent lots of their private time learning. I don’t think this junior has spent any time learning in his private time.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I don’t want to ask them to learn in their private time, but I just can’t help feel annoyed about the fact that he still cannot pick up a well-defined task in our backlog and complete it by himself. I think he really needs to take some time learning some basics like networking and some skills like keyboard shortcuts of text editors. I know there is lots to learn. However, sometimes I lose my patience when I have to repeat myself.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In addition to lack of knowledge and skills, I feel that he always waits somebody to tell him what to do and explain everything to him. I tried to tell him the whole picture of the project before explain a specific task, but I couldn’t see any improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What could I do to help him (or make myself feel better)?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>I’ve worked with 3 managers in the past 2 years at my first company and all of them seem to have trouble producing results from team meetings and one on ones. More specifically, my managers have mentioned things/events/changes they would plan to do with the team or me and several weeks/months go by and the idea is never mentioned again. At times it felt like maybe it was me that was unable to produce the outcomes of said ideas or that maybe I was some sort of a lost cause.

He has learned things at a reasonable speed but it is still hard for him to implement new features without any help or existing code to copy.\n\r\n\r\n    \nIn past jobs, I usually gave juniors simple, easy tasks, but we don’t have that simple tasks in my current job because we’re working on complicated internal systems.\n\r\n\r\n    \nAlso other junior developers spent lots of their private time learning. I don’t think this junior has spent any time learning in his private time.\n\r\n\r\n    \nI don’t want to ask them to learn in their private time, but I just can’t help feel annoyed about the fact that he still cannot pick up a well-defined task in our backlog and complete it by himself. I think he really needs to take some time learning some basics like networking and some skills like keyboard shortcuts of text editors. I know there is lots to learn. However, sometimes I lose my patience when I have to repeat myself.\n\r\n\r\n    \nIn addition to lack of knowledge and skills, I feel that he always waits somebody to tell him what to do and explain everything to him. I tried to tell him the whole picture of the project before explain a specific task, but I couldn’t see any improvement.\n\r\n\r\n    \nWhat could I do to help him (or make myself feel better)?\n\r\n  \n\r\n  \n\r\n    \nI’ve worked with 3 managers in the past 2 years at my first company and all of them seem to have trouble producing results from team meetings and one on ones.

I also don’t think I can give him divorce advice. What would you do?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Hi there. I just graduated from undergrad and will be starting my career in just a few days. A big question on my mind going in is whether software development is the right career for me. I landed here because my parents saw me tinkering with HTML as a kid and pushed me into a CS major and this job. Me personally, I had wildly varying attitudes towards programming in college. Some days I was so hungry that I threw myself into hackathons and side projects; other days I was ready to drop my CS major. All this left me unsure of where I really stand. I’m grateful to have ended up on this path, but as I think more long-term, I question whether I’m really here for the long haul. What signs could I look for to gauge my compatibility with the tech industry or help me decide whether this career is really for me?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Either way, thanks so much for making this podcast - it’s been a great window into the world that I’m about to join.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

I’m worried that my “hard” engineering skills are deteriorating with every passing week.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>All of this is made more difficult by the disturbed job market at the moment and the fact that if I stay at my role for another 7 months, I will receive a sizeable retention payment.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What should I do?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I love the podcast. Keep up the great work.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

I’ve been working on some project and different teams, and it has been more than 1 year on my current team. One day, someone mentioned me that their service is down because of my code from when I was on the previous team and I didn’t even touch that code for almost 2 years. I explained that I am in different team now, so I refer them to the current members of my old team.

Including (but not limited to) deploying and releasing after hours, shared responsibility with the resident senior devs for reviewing pull requests, and aiding in the creation of new processes and overall advancement of our company’s software development process and culture. How soon is too soon to ask for a raise after starting a new job?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Listener Andrew asks,</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>As a military veteran of 8 years, I have the opportunity to enroll in a masters program for little to no cost, but I’m not sure what kind of program to choose.\r\nI’m a web developer and also serve as my team’s ”Agile Owner” (kind of like a Scrum Master) which I really enjoy. In fact, before I got my first dev job, I trained in Scrum to try to get a leadership role in the software industry and use my bachelor’s in engineering management. It seems logical to continue in that vein and choose an engineering management masters program, but I enjoy being a direct contributor and applying my Agile training without any real responsibility as a manager would have.\r\nI sometimes think I should go for a masters in computer science and double down as a technical knowledge worker, but I fear I’d be in way over my head since I don’t have an institutional computer science background. On the opposite end of the spectrum, part of me thinks I should get an MBA like some friends from college to hedge my bets for climbing corporate ladders in the future. On top of that, lately I’ve been very interested in learning more about design.\r\nI’m just not sure what to do, and I have a habit of making big decisions with my head instead of my heart which sometimes leads to 8 years in military service which I don’t much enjoy, so I’d love any advice I can get. Thanks! Soft Skills Eng is my absolute favorite software industry podcast.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

I get to the office 20 minutes early but have to wait 45 minutes more for my first round of interviews because an internal meeting went over; the recruiter apologizes and asks if I want breakfast, and I say I’ll take something small like a bagel; she says okay and disappears from the room never to return with food.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I get through the culture interviews just fine, though I thought it was a bit odd that several of my interviewers (including a VP) brought in their catered breakfast/lunch into the room but never offered me to get some and I had to go find my recruiter so I could get a cup of water between interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The final interview was with who would have been my boss: the senior engineering lead. She proceeds to ask me the normal bank of engineering questions and then lets me ask anything.

Is it okay that I would develop on a Windows machine?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The engineering lead takes me to the recruiter’s office so I can wrap up the day but the recruiter had left early and nobody knew where she had gone so I was escorted to the front door by a receptionist and left. I didn’t hear back for a week and got a call late in the evening saying they had moved on with other candidates.

One day I was uploading a new site, which involved FTPing into the server and doing all the config myself. I didn’t really know what I was doing, all of this terminal stuff was pretty alien to me at the time. For some reason or another I needed to change the permissions on the files for this site, so I uploaded it to the server and ran a chmod, (which was a brand new concept to me - luckily Stack Overflow had my back. OR DID IT?) Anyway, when I ran the command, my terminal went crazy and way more files went flying up the screen than I had for my website, so I thought ““that doesn’t look right””, hit ctrl-c and went to lunch, thinking I’d fix it later.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When I got back from lunch, everyone was rushing about like headless chickens. Everything was down. When I enquired, it turned out that for some reason everyone was locked out of the entire server. After several hours it turned out that all of the permissions for every file on the server had been changed and nobody had any access to anything. Also, every client site had been brought down in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>To make matters slightly worse, when I enquired about backups, it turned out that the main server WAS the backup server, because the main server died a couple of years before and nobody had bothered to fix or replace it.

However, in less than two weeks I was in a new role with a 25% pay increase, and my career has bloomed ever since. So 👍🏻 I guess!</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And here ends my tale.

It was with a healthcare tech startup. The building was across the street from the healthcare tech company where my wife worked. After meeting the 9 people on the team and doing some white boarding, I met with the CEO. When he asked why I was excited to work at his company, I mentioned in passing that my wife worked at the company across the street.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>CEO then says “Oh, wow. They just announced that they are going public.”</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>At this point, the company had not announced that they were going public yet, but my wife already knew about it and told me that it wouldn’t happen for a few months. I demurred, but the CEO pressed more “Yeah, I saw it on the news this morning.”</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Yep. The CEO of a company that rivals my wife’s was asking for insider trading information. I actually had to rehash my conversation to my wife’s boss to make sure I didn’t give away anything important (which I fortunately did not).</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>After that, I decided I would never work for any company in the same industry as where my wife works.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>About 7 years ago I was looking for a side income. A fellow engineer I worked with told me that the park he spends his weekends at was looking for someone to build them a website, run some wires and a bunch of other IT odd jobs. I was interested so I made the drive down to the park which further confirmed my suspections of my co worker: it was a nudist facility.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I sat in my car for a few minutes to consider my options and walked in. It’s weird how being the only clothed person in the room made me feel so awkwardly naked. I spoke to the owner, shared my resume, and my co worker showed up (naked) to vouch for me. I got the job but only under the condition i ““wore the uniform””. I agreed and worked there over the summer weekends for a few months doing everything in the buff.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Being near the beginning of my career I wanted to put this on my resume, but didn’t want to expose the private parts of this job. I ended up listing it as ‘contracter’ with just a note: references available on request.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>The company I work at is a privately owned B-to-C e-commerce shopping platform. Over the past two years the non technical management has been trying to position themselves to be bought out.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Their strategy has been to create a new layer of director level management and hire in candidates directly from FAANG with the specific intent of injecting “FAANG” culture into the company. I guess the thought is - if you want to be acquired from a player like FAANG, then become a mini FAANG.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Unfortunately, it hasn’t been working out so well. The 💩hit the fan.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The new director have absolute power, and as it goes, ““absolute power corrupts absolutely””.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The new Director of Engineering did a culling of senior engineers and managers that raised any questions to initiatives proposed by the director (you know, healthy project analysis probing to make sure potential risks are considered). One day, 15 devs were let go. These were senior engineers with years of domain knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Not surprisingly, the platform started to have issues. Payment processing integrations started going down, checkout processes needed maintenance - but… the domain knowledge was gone. In the usual “throw more people at the problem” approach, everyone was assigned pager duty, even for systems they didn’t know. The system got so bad that the director resorted to shutting off one of the major payment processing integrations since it couldn’t be fixed. This had repercussions of course, and we started losing completed checkout conversions.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The rest of the senior engineers were leaving voluntarily at this point.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Now that the ship was pretty much on fire, and the engineering department pretty much destroyed, we found out that the director was applying to another job at the new Twilio office in the city 😂.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We found out he got rejected because his reputation had preceded him and the recruiters at Twilio had actually heard about the mayhem he was causing at our company.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But it gets better! One of my coworkers thought it would be a funny prank to put a Twilio sticker on the director’s office window. Nope, my colleague was promptly fired.

They just announced that they are going public.”</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>At this point, the company had not announced that they were going public yet, but my wife already knew about it and told me that it wouldn’t happen for a few months. I demurred, but the CEO pressed more “Yeah, I saw it on the news this morning.”</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Yep. The CEO of a company that rivals my wife’s was asking for insider trading information. I actually had to rehash my conversation to my wife’s boss to make sure I didn’t give away anything important (which I fortunately did not).</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>After that, I decided I would never work for any company in the same industry as where my wife works.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>About 7 years ago I was looking for a side income. A fellow engineer I worked with told me that the park he spends his weekends at was looking for someone to build them a website, run some wires and a bunch of other IT odd jobs. I was interested so I made the drive down to the park which further confirmed my suspections of my co worker: it was a nudist facility.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I sat in my car for a few minutes to consider my options and walked in. It’s weird how being the only clothed person in the room made me feel so awkwardly naked. I spoke to the owner, shared my resume, and my co worker showed up (naked) to vouch for me. I got the job but only under the condition i ““wore the uniform””. I agreed and worked there over the summer weekends for a few months doing everything in the buff.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Being near the beginning of my career I wanted to put this on my resume, but didn’t want to expose the private parts of this job. I ended up listing it as ‘contracter’ with just a note: references available on request.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>The company I work at is a privately owned B-to-C e-commerce shopping platform. Over the past two years the non technical management has been trying to position themselves to be bought out.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Their strategy has been to create a new layer of director level management and hire in candidates directly from FAANG with the specific intent of injecting “FAANG” culture into the company. I guess the thought is - if you want to be acquired from a player like FAANG, then become a mini FAANG.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Unfortunately, it hasn’t been working out so well. The 💩hit the fan.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The new director have absolute power, and as it goes, ““absolute power corrupts absolutely””.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The new Director of Engineering did a culling of senior engineers and managers that raised any questions to initiatives proposed by the director (you know, healthy project analysis probing to make sure potential risks are considered). One day, 15 devs were let go. These were senior engineers with years of domain knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Not surprisingly, the platform started to have issues. Payment processing integrations started going down, checkout processes needed maintenance - but… the domain knowledge was gone. In the usual “throw more people at the problem” approach, everyone was assigned pager duty, even for systems they didn’t know. The system got so bad that the director resorted to shutting off one of the major payment processing integrations since it couldn’t be fixed. This had repercussions of course, and we started losing completed checkout conversions.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The rest of the senior engineers were leaving voluntarily at this point.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Now that the ship was pretty much on fire, and the engineering department pretty much destroyed, we found out that the director was applying to another job at the new Twilio office in the city 😂.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We found out he got rejected because his reputation had preceded him and the recruiters at Twilio had actually heard about the mayhem he was causing at our company.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But it gets better! One of my coworkers thought it would be a funny prank to put a Twilio sticker on the director’s office window. Nope, my colleague was promptly fired. We later found out that the director was so pissed that he ended up going through the CCTV surveillance recordings to see which employees had entered the building early to find out who put the sticker on his office window 🤦🏻‍♂️.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Had a manager who had transitioned to IT help-desk work from teaching elementary school and then worked their way up to manager over a large development team. They never let go of the elementary teacher mentality. The highlights were:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Requiring multiple forced-fun team activities a year, like cubicle decoration contests.</li>\r\n      <li>Playground level nick-names for everyone on the team. (Think banana-fo-fana level rhyming).</li>\r\n      <li>All team members got emoji stress balls, and were required to place the ball that reflected their daily mood on the wall of the entrance of their workstation.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

However, whenever we have company “fun” events, the Asian managers schedule it in the morning so that our regular work schedule won’t be consumed. So we’ll do badminton or wall-climbing from 9AM to 12 and then have to do the 2PM to 11PM shift. This is very tiring. The events usually happen every two weeks, but our schedule makes me dread them.

I just started listening to your show and I already have experienced a steep improvement from a puny 10x dev to 11x one.\r\nMy question, if you’ll be kind enough to answer is:\r\nHow do I convince my cheapskate boss to sponsor me flying across the pond to give a talk at a conference I was selected for. Should I sponsor it myself in case of a decline? Should I hint at a possible job quitting if I am declined (I am currently seeking a new job)? Should I go forward with the talk if I do quit and the  content of the talk is largely about the job I did there in the last couple of years.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Note, I am widely regarded as an excellent employee by my superiors and colleagues. I earn quite a bit less than my current value and I am currently back, looking for a job.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>That’s it from me, love you guys!</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

I have a small team of 3 developers under me. I am essentially the “person who wrote all the code”. I have an offer from another startup for more money and more percentages of the company and they want me over there asap.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I’m afraid to quit this startup as I fear that it’s not yet at a place where it could survive without me. I realize that sounds super egotistical but unfortunately I don’t have a successor ATM and none of the other developers are at a level where I could potentially train them to be my successor in the time frame I have with the other offer.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The other sticky thing is that the current startup probably doesn’t have enough money to hire someone at my level for what they’d actually be worth. I, and the rest of the team, are severely underpaid, as this is a bootstrapped startup. Love your show, would love to hear your guys’ take on this.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>I recently interned at a local factory to help clean up some broken 20 year old databases. After remaking them, I quickly became a rising star and word spread fast of my aptitude. I was offered a full time salary position, in which I was able to negotiate for some special privileges and a cool title: software engineer.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I am having an awesome time building little tools for various departments while learning different languages. I’ve been very fulfilled with the projects and recognition I’ve been getting, there’s just one problem: the IT department absolutely despises me.\r\nThey see my sole existence as an affront to their entire structure.

However, our culture is different so I don’t know how to behave or how straightforward, informal or political I must be. I’m always afraid of offending someone. What kind of things I never should say or do when dealing with Americans? We Brazilians become friendly and intimate very fast. Do you guys notice these kind of different behavior from different cultures?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

I asked someone to log in and let me look at the notebook in question that was causing an issue. I saw what I needed and then randomly clicked on another notebook so the problem notebook wasn’t open as I was trying to fix it.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Later I approached the HR person to show me how they do something in OneNote. They opened OneNote and the page that opened up was MY employee records! OneNote syncs which page was opened last, which means the page I randomly clicked on when they were logged in on my computer was my employee record, and they knew it!</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>They confronted me about it (not making too huge a deal about it). I tried to explain how I just clicked randomly and I wasn’t snooping, but it felt like everything I said only dug me deeper.\r\nI’m having trouble staying in the same room with them because of the shame (entirely internal) and I’m worried if I ever need to look at their PC again they will want full visibility to make sure I’m not snooping (not ideal).\r\nI want to make this right, but all I can come up with is honor based suicide rituals. What do I do?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Your faithful listener,</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Stefan</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>I’m an engineer in a small start-up. I work half of each week remotely, half in-person, as do the other engys. One of the other engineers is exceptionally skilled and experienced, way more so than I, but they are not very communicative when working remotely. The leader (understandably) becomes quite nervous as a result, especially since minor health issues have kept this engineer from working full throttle for a couple of weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What, if anything, can I do to help the leader trust this engy who doesn’t like to chatter on slack?

They play games during the lunch hour, and if we end up having lunch together, everyone is talking about the game that they are playing or some news in the gaming circle.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>As a non-gamer and introvert, I find it different to join in their conversation. How can I join in, or bring the talk back to something else?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>I’ve been working as an Android Engineer for 7 years from the beginning of my career. I loved my profession but things started to go not so well with reaching of the senior level.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Coding tasks became boring because I knew how to solve them before starting. Most of the time I was helping less senior engineers but it didn’t give me satisfaction.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I tried to solve the problem by quitting my job. I joined a company with a team of only senior engineers hoping that it meant more challenging tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Things did not improve. Tasks are still boring and I don’t learn anything new from my colleagues because they are around the same tech level as me.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I don’t think I’m burned out because I still enjoy programming when I need to use my brain for solving a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I don’t want to move to management because I like coding more than people.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I don’t want to switch to another tech stack because it means a pay cut and I think that I’ll get bored again in a year or so.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Is it some kind of quarter-career crisis? Is there a way to be an expert at the field and still like your job?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

In practice this means that we got more processes to follow, more meetings to attend and more time-tracking fuss.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I’m trying to keep an open mind because I, as a programmer, also have high standards for the product and it’s development. I’m scared that programmers are being turned in to factory workers stripped of any autonomy. These new processes don’t allow me to do anything without my product owner’s approval. I’m afraid that it will limit my creativity and ultimately cause my work and the product to suffer.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In this kind of scenario, what’s your advice for a programmer who often gets inspired to remove tech debt, tinker with our dev environment, and otherwise make small improvements and refactorings that shouldn’t require management approval?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What’s your opinion on the level of freedom that programmers should be provided in order to do their job well?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n",

I’m scared that programmers are being turned in to factory workers stripped of any autonomy. These new processes don’t allow me to do anything without my product owner’s approval. I’m afraid that it will limit my creativity and ultimately cause my work and the product to suffer.\n\r\n\r\n    \nIn this kind of scenario, what’s your advice for a programmer who often gets inspired to remove tech debt, tinker with our dev environment, and otherwise make small improvements and refactorings that shouldn’t require management approval?\n\r\n\r\n    \nWhat’s your opinion on the level of freedom that programmers should be provided in order to do their job well?",

And what’s the best way to cast a net via co-workers, friends, &amp; family?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The details of my situation are that I’m trying to build a PostgreSQL database from scratch, and I’m running into lots of problems. I spent 2 hours digging through the Postgres documentation, I asked questions on my University Slack channel, and even the PostgreSQL team Slack with no answers. I also reached out to my boss. But I still have no answers.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In any case, I’m just happy I had the wherewithal to walk away after 2 hours instead of spiraling into an absolute rage and wasting my night cursing PostgreSQL.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Should a team lead do technical work or restrict himself to people management? What are the pros and cons from each approach?</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>HR in my company wants to change from a unified model of team and tech leads (single person performing both roles) to a split model (one team lead with multiple tech leads that hold no people management responsibilities) and I’m not sure what to think about this. I feel not having the team leads ““on the ground”” will make them less effective in the people management aspect.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

I initially said I would like to stay, and was told there was some negative feedback from coworkers I’d need to work on to do so.

I don’t think this is necessarily anyone’s fault, and I love the idea of making sure all sorts of folks have a path to contribute, but many times when I’ve seen these types of meetings organized, many participants don’t have enough context, or subject matter expertise to produce genuinely helpful ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I think it’s really powerful when cross-discipline teams collaborate well on a project or feature, so I guess I’m wondering if there are practical ways to generate the culture of trust and mutual respect that is needed for this to actually work.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>First time question asker, long time listener here. We have a Really Important Problem at work: in Slack, people tend to use @channel instead of @here. What are some strategies for educating everyone that they should be using @here and not @channel? I especially don’t want anyone to feel shamed or called-out in the moment. Thanks!</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

In my previous job, same with Jira and Jenkins. As an engineer, do managers really need these crazy processes that get in the way or am I naive engineer who doesn’t really understand the value of these processes?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Just wanted to preface by saying that I absolutely love your podcast. It’s definitely helped me mold into a better developer and team player!</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>My company is having a tough time raising our next round. In light of this, I am actively looking for my next position. Financial stability and growth is my biggest concern as I am planning to get married, buy our own place, and have kids. My goal is to interview at multiple companies and get competing offers. From a hiring perspective, I can definitely see how companies and see this in a negative light. How do I navigate salary negotiations so that I can get the best deal (financially) without being stereotyped?</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

My company is awesome;  All of my coworkers are super talented/motivated.  On top of that we get to work with modern tech stacks (React, Elm, Go, Rust, Kafka, you name it, we can use it).  I have heard rumors that it’s hard to move back to private industry after working in this world due to working with old/legacy tech and the view that defense contractors generally have less than stellar engineers.

As a manager I don’t want to stifle innovation, but need to find a balance on being able to meet business goals on schedule.</li>\r\n  <li>I want to add an automatic formatting tool to our code, but my co-worker is resistant to the idea. He started this project and I’m brand new to it.  I don’t want to push it too much, but I would really love to use it. I’ve shared with him all the reasons that it would be good, and addressed most of his concerns. I’ve also submitted a PR to show him what it would look like.  Also, he is in another timezone 9 hours away, so communication is all on GitHub, Slack, and the occasional video call (if I wake up early).  He finally said if it really helps me, then I can go for it, but I don’t think he would like it if I did. Should I go for it? Try to convince him more? Or just drop it?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"
