But soon, Glamrou became so much for than an act. \n\nAs Matthew discovers, alter egos might start out feeling like role play, but they have the power to transform us in profound and lasting ways. And it turns out that some of the most successful people around have used them to get the edge, from Beyoncé to Rafael Nadal.\n\nBut the benefits of alter egos aren’t limited to the stage or the sports field. Studies show that even children can benefit from taking on alter-egos, and you might just find there are already things you do to harness other identities and shift your perspective when the moment calls for it. \n\nWith screenwriter, author and drag performer Amrou Al-Kadhi (drag name Glamrou), author and coach, Todd Herman, and Ethan Kross, Professor of Psychology and Business at the University of Michigan and the director of the Emotion and Self Control Laboratory. \n\nPresenter: Matthew Syed\nProducer: Claire Crofton\nSeries Editor and exec producer: Katherine Godfrey\nMusic, Sound Design and Mix: Nicholas Alexander\nTheme Music: Seventy Times Seven by Ioana Selaru\nA Novel production for BBC Radio 4"

That was a question the trial didn’t answer and only Christopher’s killers could. \n\nYears later, they would meet the three boys, by now men, to ask that question - why?\n \nCriminal justice asks what laws have been broken, who broke them, and how the lawbreaker should be punished.

His new book lies ready to be pulped.\n\nIn the first of a new series of Sideways, Matthew Syed asks why we’re doomed to be unoriginal and why it hurts so much to be, well, not that special.\n\nIn 1998, Hollywood directors Matthew Bay and Mimi Leder went head to head with suspiciously similar disaster movies -  Armageddon and Deep Impact. Allegations of late-night spying flew around. But could there have just been something in the air? Matthew reveals that, four years earlier, fragments of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 Comet smashed into Jupiter and right into the American consciousness.\n\nThis is the thing... As Matthew discovers, our brains are wired for unoriginality, we evolve as a collective brain, absorbing our shared cultural cues and looking for what has worked in the past. But if that’s the norm, why do we feel so disappointed when our ideas seem unoriginal, when someone else beats us to it? And is there a way out of this - to rekindle our originality?\n\nWith author Ian Leslie, Kristen Lopez, TV editor for Indiewire and pop culture critic, Dr Michael Muthukrishna, Associate Professor of Economic Psychology at the London School of Economics and Nick Groom, Professor of Literature in English, University of Macau.\n\nPresenter: Matthew Syed\nProducer/Series Editor: Katherine Godfrey\nExecutive Producer: Max O'Brien\nMusic, Sound Design and Mix: Nicholas Alexander\nResearch and Development: Gavin Haynes and Madeleine Parr\nTheme Music: Seventy Times Seven by Ioana Selaru\nA Novel production for BBC Radio 4",

                "summary": "Matthew Syed asks what the world's greatest fighter pilot can tell us about decision making. He discovers a theory that transformed warfare and might have played a key role in Brexit.\n\nJohn Boyd was a rebel. The quintessential fighter pilot, complete with a cigar permanently installed in his mouth. A legend within the US Air Force, he was known to be able to shoot down any opponent in a dogfight in under 40 seconds.\n\nBoyd developed a decision making tool that would take the military by storm. He argued that the path to victory could be boiled down to a core process: observe, orient, decide, act - OODA. He explained that this process looped, with each action leading to a new opportunity to observe. To defeat an enemy all you had to do was disrupt their OODA loop. \n\nMatthew will reveal that Dominic Cummings is a Boyd devotee, deploying his decision making tactics during the Brexit campaign with great effect.\n\nWhile the OODA loop is highly effecting in confrontational settings, Matthew asks whether this form of thinking works when co-operation, rather than domination, is the name of the game.\n\nProducer: Robbie MacInnes\nMusic, Sound Design and Mix: Benbrick\nSeries Editor: Russell Finch\nExecutive Producer: Sean Glynn and Max O'Brien\n\nA Novel production for BBC Radio 4"

There’s a good reason for doing this. It turns out that 96% of psychological experiments have been carried out on western students. Why is this? Because western students are easy to access for a psychologist working in a university.\n\nThis might sound convenient, but there’s a problem - it turns out that westerners think in a particular way. Easily reproducible experimental findings in the west don’t stack up when you use non-western subjects. Many of our classical assertions about the workings of the human mind are based entirely on the western human mind.\n\nMatthew digs into the deep roots of the western mind and asks whether a ban on cousin marriage triggered a surge of innovation in the west as tribal boundaries broke down.\n\nIt’s an intriguing theory, but does it stack up?
