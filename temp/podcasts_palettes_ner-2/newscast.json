The capital has come under attack, but the residents and their president remain defiant, and Russian forces have so far failed to break through their resistance.\n\nMaxim Karaush was at home with family when their apartment building in Kyiv was hit by a missile. He tells Victoria and Gabriel why, after his wife and son were injured and his home destroyed, he asked to speak to us.\n\nWe aim to explain a fast-moving conflict and answer your questions about the war. Vitaly is with us again too, and he's been following a group of Ukrainian men in England as they prepare to return to fight for their homeland.\n\nThis episode of Ukrainecast was made by Estelle Doyle with Daniel Wittenberg and Phil Marzouk. The editor is Jonathan Aspinwall."

                "summary": "Filling up on Labour conference, Germany elections and HGV news. Shadow cabinet minister, Andy McDonald, has quit Labour’s frontbench with a scathing attack on Sir Keir Starmer on the eve of his major speech to the Brighton delegates. He’s accused the Labour leader of making the party “more divided than ever” and breaking promises to members over working conditions. Adam and Laura are on the conference floor to assess how it’s gone down. Plus, Laura stumbles across Newscast superfan Jacob, who wangles his way onto the pod.\n\nAlso in a Brexitcast-esque crossover, Katya calls in from Berlin, where Germany's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have claimed a narrow election victory, telling the party of Angela Merkel it should no longer be in power. But the outgoing chancellor’s retirement is on hold for what could be weeks of coalition negotiations, with conservative Armin Laschet determined to fight on.\n\nToday’s Newscast was made by Caitlin Hanrahan with producers Danny Wittenberg, Ben Cooper and Soila Apparicio. The studio director was Emma Crowe and the assistant editor was Sam Bonham. The editor is Jonathan Aspinwall."
