    "description": "Host Maya Shankar blends compassionate storytelling with the science of human behavior to help us understand who we are and who we become in the face of a big change. \nYou’ll hear intimate conversations that give an unvarnished look into how people navigate changes of all kinds -- like Tiffany Haddish, Kacey Musgraves, Amanda Knox, and Riz Ahmed, as well as real-life inspirations, like John, who undergoes experimental brain stimulation to deepen his emotional intelligence; Shapearl, who takes on the role of private investigator to uncover the truth about her son’s death; and Daryl, a Black jazz musician who convinces hundreds of KKK members to leave the Klan. The show also features interviews with science experts like Adam Grant, Angela Duckworth, and Katy Milkman who share strategies for how we can live happier and more fulfilling lives. You’ll leave every episode thinking differently about change in your own life. \nYou can follow the show @DrMayaShankar on Instagram.",

The show also features interviews with science experts like Adam Grant, Angela Duckworth, and Katy Milkman who share strategies for how we can live happier and more fulfilling lives. You’ll leave every episode thinking differently about change in your own life. \nYou can follow the show @DrMayaShankar on Instagram."
