            "content": "<p>Today’s message comes from a series on the topic of wisdom in the book of Proverbs. What is wisdom? In 1 Kings 3, Solomon prays for wisdom, and he defines it like this. He says, “God, give me a heart that can discern right from wrong.” You might say, “He was the king of Israel. He had the law of God. Why does he need a heart to discern right from wrong?” The answer is that wisdom is more than just knowing what’s good and what’s bad. It’s knowing what the right decision to make is — what the right course of action is — in the vast majority of life situations the moral rules don’t address.</p>\r\n\n<p>If you’re going to live a wise life, you need to understand anger. You need to be able to understand and handle anger, not only in yourself, but in other people as well. There are four things we’re going to learn about anger that you have to know to be wise: its power; its goodness;  why it goes wrong; and how it can be healed.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 17, 2004. Series: Proverbs: True Wisdom for Living. Scripture: Proverbs 14:29-30; 15:1, 18; 16:32; 19:11, 19; 24:28-29; 25:21-22.</p>\r\n\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

It is knowing the right thing to do in the vast majority of life situations in which the moral rules don’t apply or in which there are multiple permissible options. </p>\r\n\n<p>Why is it that so many religious communities want to make up new rules? One answer is that we won’t have to think. We want a rule to cover every single situation, so we don’t have to apply wisdom and think out the implications. But the truth is that you can never create enough rules to cover every situation. This is where wisdom comes in — you have to know something about the true nature of reality. Today we’re going to look at 1) the persistence of reality, 2) the problems with reality, and 3) how it gets healed. If you want to be wise, you have to know all three.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 3, 2004. Series: Proverbs: True Wisdom for Living. Scripture: Proverbs 5:16-23 and Revelation 21:1-5.</p>\r\n\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

Today we’re going to look at 1) the importance of wisdom, 2) the definition of wisdom, 3) the problem of wisdom, and 4) a clue to its solution.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 12, 2004. Series: Proverbs: True Wisdom for Living. Scripture: Proverbs 8:10-16; 22-31.</p>\r\n\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

I think, however, the important thing would probably be to get the gist of it, the point, which I think is actually in verse 8. Then we can come back and look at the parts and the details later without losing our way or being confused. This passage in the very beginning, which we began looking at last week, talks about, “How do you get the Spirit? How do you have spiritual power?” It’s a very, very relevant question nowadays.</p>\r\n\n<p>Here you have Paul talking about the Spirit. How do you get into contact with the Spirit? He keeps on saying “hearing.” The first five verses are all about hearing. You have to hear. It’s not what you do; it’s what you hear. It’s the message. In this case we see where it’s from. He’s talking, of course, about the gospel; the gospel is the way. Well, how do you find the gospel? How do you know the gospel? In verse 8 we have a stunning verse. Here’s basically what verse 8 says: “The Scripture preached the gospel to Abraham.” You have a very important and “bipolar” truth.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 7, 1997. Series: Galatians: New Freedom, New Family. Scripture: Galatians 3:1-9.</p>\r\n\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

We saw that the problem was the message of a certain group of religious teachers.</p>\r\n\n<p>Their point was believing in Jesus Christ was very important; they weren’t against Christ. But they said you have to add to Jesus Christ, his work, his love; faith and union with his work and his love is not enough to cleanse and beautify you. It’s not enough. You have to believe in Christ, and, in their case, they said you have to adopt the entire Mosaic law, all the ceremonial laws. The important thing is the principle of the gospel: is Jesus Christ’s work and love enough to cleanse and beautify you all by itself? Paul’s answer is “Yes.” For these folks the answer was “No.”</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 9, 1997.

After living for centuries in a culture in which the cultural institutions supported their belief in God, they found themselves in Babylon, which was a religiously pluralistic society. This big city had many gods and many moralities. This naturally created tension because the Israelites believed in the one true God of the Bible. </p>\r\n\n<p>In a similar way, how do we live as believers in a pluralistic society? We may be accused of being intolerant of those who don’t believe like us. Or we may face hard questions about our God allowing unjust suffering in the world. How do we handle that? Today’s passage from the book of Daniel helps us navigate these issues. First of all, let’s take a look at the golden image, which addresses the problem of tolerance, and then we’ll look at the fiery furnace, which addresses the problem of unjust suffering.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 7, 2000.

                "summary": "<p>Moral reformation is the main source in the world for many good things, like honesty, self-control and generosity. This kind of reformation enforces rules. One wants to obey out of self-interest or out of fear. On the other hand, spiritual transformation consists of a deeper heart change. When the heart changes, then one’s life, including actions and behavior, changes. In short, moral reformation happens by looking at rules; spiritual transformation happens by looking at Jesus (2 Corinthians 3:18). </p>\r\n\n<p>We’re going to look at Jesus in today’s passage from Mark 14 when Jesus’ disciples fall asleep. They were supposed to be keeping watch. Something utterly shocks Jesus and he says that it is his time to die. It comes upon him suddenly. There are three words that give us clues to what’s happening in this passage: the cup, Abba, and began.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 10, 1998.

Our text today is not really about fathers and mothers, although it would appear to be so on the surface, but it’s about discipleship. It’s about what it means to exclusively follow Jesus and be his disciple.

There has been a violation of the range of your effective will. </p>\r\n\n<p>What does it mean, then, to put yourself within the range of God’s effective will? It means that you get a lasting identity that goes on for eternity, and it is marked by astounding liberality. Let’s look more closely at how we can get that kind of identity. </p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 4, 2003. Series: \"The Meaning of Jesus Part 4; The Kingdom of God.\" Scripture: Luke 16:19-31.</p>\r\n\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

            "content": "<p>One of the great questions of history is, “Why in the world did the early Christians adopt the cross as their main symbol?” Do you realize why that is so odd? On the cross, Jesus died at age 33 in agony, abandoned by everyone in his life. All the other founders of religions died old and “successful.” For example, Buddha lived to be 80 years old and achieved enlightenment. And Muhammad lived into his 60s during which he united all of Arabia under one faith. There is a vivid contrast with the picture of Jesus. Why in the world would anyone look at Jesus dying on a cross and say, “That’s the life I want to live. That’s the one I want to follow. That’s the faith for me”?</p>\r\n\n<p>On the night before he died, Jesus gave his disciples the explanation of the meaning of his death in the upper room. When it was all over, they remembered it and they accepted it. It changed them. If you see what Jesus says to them and you take it in, it will change you too. There are four things which are life-changing about Jesus’ death: 1) it is the center of history; 2) it is the foundation for a radically new, profoundly different community; 3) it is the solution to the great mystery; and 4) it is appropriated personally.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 6, 2003.

Paul says that Jesus Christ has “blessed us” with “every spiritual blessing.” This is what we mean by salvation. We’re going to learn how we get every spiritual blessing, what those spiritual blessings are, why we can have those spiritual blessings, and how to know whether you have them. \n\r\n\nThis sermon was preached by Rev. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 1, 2015. Series \"What We Believe: Foundations\". Scripture: Ephesians 1:3-10.\n\r\n\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 20, 2015. Series \"What We Believe: Foundations\".

            "content": "<p>In the Bible, the word flesh doesn’t simply mean your body. It doesn’t simply mean what the English word flesh means, which always means simply skin, sinew, blood, and guts. Actually, there’s a place in the Bible where God says, “I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh…” That doesn’t mean, “I will pour out my Spirit on everybody’s body.” It means, “I’ll pour out my Spirit on all people.” The word flesh means a person. When it says the two will become one flesh, it says you’ll be one person. You’re really no longer the same two people, but you’re a third entity. </p>\r\n\n<p>How is it that this one-fleshness can be developed? There are three ways it can happen and three reasons it doesn’t happen. If you do these three things properly, it develops deep oneness. If you fail to do them or if you do them wrongly, it creates something different altogether, basically a business partnership.</p>\r\n\n<p>This sermon was preached by Rev.

Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 16, 2000. Series \"St. Matthew's Passion; The World's Last Night\".
