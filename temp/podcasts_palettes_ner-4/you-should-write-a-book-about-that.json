When we tune in creatively, the world is real time offering us endless amounts of material.

Called a mix between Pema Chodron and Anne Lamott (which makes her blush), Kim shares how she allows life to unfold over the year and makes a point to write about each experience from a gunman on her roof (and the crappy boyfriend who never checks on her), to an evolving and spiritual battle with nine foot palm fronds.

            "contentSnippet": "Wendy Borlabi never considered herself ambitious but today she is the performance coach for the Chicago Bulls.  You don’t rise to this stature in the sports world taking life lightly.  She continued to connect the dots in her career, stay focused and put one foot in front of the other.  Originally from Ghana, her dad and brother watched a lot of American football...and that was family time together. It became synonymous with comfort and love and familiarity. \n  \n  She is not only highly motivated to help players get the best performance out of their game, but she also had twins by a surrogate because the time had come. She didn’t have a partner and she was looking at an operation that could affect her uterus.  So she went for it and within months of making the decision, was pregnant.\n  \n A rule breaker and a game changer, Wendy doles out some incredible “Wendy-isms” on how to have the best performance you can in your life.\n  \n \n Join us on You Tube for the live video recording of this interview. https://youtu.be/P4SnEIrhs5M  Unedited, you will feel like we just came into your living room with our conversation! \n \n  \n We appreciate any and all donations to keep bringing you incredible guests each week!

Tennis great Venus Williams also was in love with the magnesium products for pain and joined the company as a co-owner and Chief Brand Officer. \n  \n Stephanie speaks with me on what it was like to raise funds in the education space, and her transition into business ownership. She reveals undiscussed barriers for women like the hurdle of selling a female-driven product to a male investor, or the lack of education for women on how to find funding.  \n  \n Stephanie attributes her entrepreneurial spirit to her grandfather who was incarcerated in WWII internment camps for Japanese Americans, then served in the National Guard. Her grandfather stood by the golden rule - treat people how you want to be treated.  She also credits her career to excellent mentorship which she pays forward. \n  \n A self-care product company, Asutra focuses on women but find their products for relief from pain after exercise or sleep aids are for everyone.   Asutra has bigger and bolder plans in the works for 2021, so keep your eyes peeled. \n  \n Do you enjoy our podcast every week?  We would appreciate any donations so we can keep doling out honest truths and having on incredible guests.
