                "summary": "We're revisiting the first episode of Truth Be Told to take on one of the biggest questions of our time: How can I feel joy when the world is burning?\n\nWe've witnessed uprisings demand justice for Black lives; we're still living in the grips of a pandemic that is disproportionately hurting communities of color, and every industry is being held accountable for racial justice. It feels like the world is unraveling – and yet we still want to laugh, dance, and love. Truth Be Told’s host Tonya Mosley travels to her hometown of Detroit to talk with her grandmother, Ernestine Mosley and New York Times best-selling author adrienne maree brown. The three women share captivating conversations and life lessons on how we all can and should cultivate joy.\nEpisode transcript: https://rb.gy/e1ik4k",
