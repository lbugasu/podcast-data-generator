We're taking a second listen today, to celebrate the legendary center fielder's 90th birthday (on May 4th).</p><p>Baseball fans may argue to this day about which was the best of Willie Mays’ many spectacular catches, but nearly all agree — he was one of the most versatile, virtuosic players of all time. In this episode, featuring an intimate interview with Mays recorded in 1996, the Hall-of-Famer talks about growing up in segregated Alabama, and winning over racist baseball fans soon after he became the first African-American player on his team. He recalls the day he got the call to move up to the majors, and describes in delightful terms how he never had to actually work at being a great athlete.

He was one of the most prolific and esteemed American writers of his generation, who won two Pulitzer Prizes for his &quot;Rabbit&quot; novels but was as well known for his stories and essays and works of literary criticism. He talks here about his very beginnings in a small Pennsylvania town,  and about his mother, who inspired him with her own efforts to get published.

His team, the Boston Celtics, won eleven NBA championships between 1957 and 1969, eight of those in a row.   Russell changed the game of basketball, with his incredible speed, and his ability to block shots as no player had  done before.  When he took over as coach of the Celtics (while still playing on the team), he became the first African-American coach of any major sport in the United States.  In this episode, Russell talks about his life in basketball, and he describes how the racism he confronted on and off the court, shaped him as a player.</p>\n<p>Music in this episode is from BenSound.com.</p>\n",

            "content:encoded": "<p>Meet two giants of the American theater: playwright August Wilson and director Lloyd Richards.   Together they brought many award-winning plays to Broadway, including &quot;Fences,&quot; &quot;Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,&quot; and &quot;The Piano Lesson.&quot;   August Wilson, who wrote ten plays (together known as the Century Cycle), started out as a poet.  When he turned to writing plays, intent on telling the stories of African-Americans on stage, it was Lloyd Richards who recognized his talent and helped him shape it.  Richards was already an icon in the theater world.  He had begun his career a generation before,  aspiring to be an actor at a time when there were almost no roles for African-Americans.  His big break came when Sidney Poitier asked him to direct a new play called &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; by Lorraine Hansberry.   In this episode you'll hear Lloyd Richards tell the story behind that ground-breaking production.   You'll also hear both August Wilson and Lloyd Richards describe how they came to meet and have one of the most successful artistic collaborations in history.</p>\n<p>Music in this episode by Charlie Haden &amp; Hank Jones, Sergei Stern, and BenSound.com.  Theme music by Kara Square.</p>\n",

He further endeared himself to the public by refusing to patent the vaccine. He had no desire to profit personally from the discovery, but merely wished to see the vaccine disseminated as widely as possible. The interview with Dr. Salk featured in this episode was recorded in 1991.  In it, Salk talks about being the child of uneducated immigrants, and carving his own path to medical school and eventually virology -- a specialty that didn't exist when he began as a researcher.  He discusses the anti-semitic quotas he had to overcome, as well as the doubt and scorn of many of his peers.  But he also describes the transformation and relief his polio vaccine brought to the world. ",
