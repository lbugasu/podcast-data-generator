This sense of stoicism, the idea you can have courage even when facing obstacles – is an ancient philosophy that was first coined during, wait for it, a pandemic. Yup, really. For more on stoicism, I recommend both Ryan Holiday’s book The Obstacle is the Way and the Tim Ferriss podcast. \nWe’re bringing you some short tips and hacks from exceptional leaders that will help frame your 2021. So hit download on this bite-sized episode for a quick dose of energy. It's basically a short black with a dash of inspo. \n ++++ \nWait, you say you want more? Guess what friends? Curveball is now the home of Australia’s first LinkedIn newsletter! I know, right? More wisdom than you can handle. It's a weekly top up of the best advice and stories leaders have that will help set you on the right path. Subscribing is totally free, so do it now for tasty inbox goodness. \nMake sure you leave us a review for the Curveball podcast in your fave podcasting app, and if there’s a leader you think we could all learn from... get in touch! Hello@deadsetstudios.com \nKeep up to date with Curveball by following @_deadsetstudios on Twitter and @deadsetstudios on instagram. We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live and work. \nThis episode was produced by the stoic Rachel Fountain. ",
