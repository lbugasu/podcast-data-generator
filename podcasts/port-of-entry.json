From KPBS and PRX, “Port of Entry” tells personal stories from this place — stories of love, hope, struggle and survival from border crossers, fronterizxs and other people whose lives are shaped around the wall. Rooted in San Diego and Tijuana, we are a transborder podcast for transborder people. We live life on la linea. Hosted by Alan Lilienthal and Natalie Gonzalez, produced by Kinsee Morlan and sound design by Emily Jankowski.",

But restaurants are being hit particularly hard.\n\nRuffo’s team had just finished remodeling the restaurant a couple of weeks before the quarantine became the new normal. \n\nEven as many restaurants layoff a lot of their staff, though, Ruffo and his partners have assured their team that they have their backs. \n\nThey’re committed to their safety and well being, even if that means taking a big financial hit. \n\nWho we are:\nHosted by Alan Lilienthal\nProduced by Kinsee Morlan\nSound design by Emily Jankowski\n\nFollow Us:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/onlyherepodcast/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/onlyherepodcast/\n\nSupport Us:\nhttps://www.kpbs.org/donate\n\nGive us Feedback:\n619-452-0228‬\npodcasts@kpbs.org\n\nPhoto:\nA picture of Ruffo Ibarra Arellano"

                "summary": "In a new episode of KPBS' border podcast \"Only Here,\" we continue our series on border art with a mural that's broadcasting the voices of deportees and those commonly known as DREAMers, children brought to the U.S. illegally as children. \n\nFrom heart-wrenching stories about parents being deported and separated from their kids to first-hand accounts of what it’s like to start a new life in a new country, the mural painted on the actual border fence uses technology to share stories of deportation and struggle. \n\nYou can hear the stories when you walk up to the mural in Playas de Tijuana. It's painted on the actual border fence, and you can use your phone to scan black-and-white QR codes printed on little stickers stuck to the mural. Scanning the stickers takes you to YouTube videos. \n\nThe stories you'll hear in the videos are from two digital storytelling archives: \n\nHumanizing Deportation: http://humanizandoladeportacion.ucdavis.edu/en/\nDacamented: https://dacamentedarchive.com/\n\nThe Playas de Tijuana Mural Project is by artist, scholar and activist Lizbeth De La Cruz Santana. More about the project here: https://lizbethdelacruzsantana.com/mural-project\n\n\nAbout the Show:\n“Only Here” is about the unexplored subcultures, creativity and struggles at the U.S.-Mexico border. The KPBS podcast tells personal stories from people whose lives are shaped by the tension reverberating around the wall. This is a show for border babies, urban explorers or those who wonder what happens when two cultures are both separated and intertwined.\n\nWho we are:\nHosted by Alan Lilienthal\nProduced by Kinsee Morlan\nSound design by Emily Jankowski \n\nFollow Us:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/onlyherepodcast/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/onlyherepodcast/\n\nSupport Us:\nhttps://www.kpbs.org/donate\n\nGive us Feedback:\n619-452-0228‬\npodcasts@kpbs.org\n\nPhoto:\nA picture of the mural by Alan Lilienthal."

We all love tacos and Tijuana has arguably some of the best in all of Mexico. Scott Koenig is always on the hunt for the best tacos in TJ. He's the writer behind the travel website “A Gringo In Mexico.\" Koenig has also written a book called “Seven Days in The Valle: Baja California’s Wine Country Cuisine” and he writes columns about food in Baja for several local publications. \n\nWe talk to Scott about living in the moment, immigration's wonderful effect on food and his outsider's take on tacos in Tijuana.

                "summary": "We wanted to take a minute or two to tell y’all about some exciting developments for the Only Here podcast team. We were recently selected to be part of a prestigious podcast accelerator program that’s pushing us to experiment, take risks and step outside of our creative comfort zones when it comes to this show.\n\nWe were one of just six public media stations from across the country chosen to be a part of a grant program called Project Catapult. We’re suuuper excited and honored to be a part of it. \n\nProject Catapult is basically a training that takes our Only Here production team to Boston once a month where we learn from a team of experts from PRX and other public media stations. \n\nPRX, by the way, is kinda on par with NPR...it’s a public media company that distributes a long list of podcast and broadcast shows that include some of the most popular in the world -- like This American Life and The Moth.  \n\nWe are learning soooo much from PRX! And one of the most important things we’ve learned is to think a looooot more about you -- our audience. \n\nSo, here we are, asking you listeners to do us a big, big favor and email us at podcasts@kpbs.org to tell us more about who you are, why you listen to the show and anything else you want us to know. Maybe there’s a person, place or thing you want us to cover -- we’re open to anything and everything. So, help us make our PRX teachers proud, and please shoot us an email and tell us who you are and what you think of our show. Thanks in advance."
