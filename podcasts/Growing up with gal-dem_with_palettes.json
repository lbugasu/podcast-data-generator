Reflecting on her upbringing and travel to the UK, Nesrine talks to Natty and Charlie about what it means to navigate the worlds of education and work having grown up in the Middle East and Northern Africa, and how our need to mythologise, create stories, and sometimes delude ourselves is a universal trait.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Nesrine reads an extract from an article written 9 years ago, and discusses how her own approach to criticism and writing has changed over the years, and how important it is to recognise and respect the ways our own experiences and advantages have shaped the way we think. Natty and Charlie reflect on this within the context of group-think, communities, and safe spaces.

                "summary": "In the last episode of Season 3, we're joined by the incredible OluTimehin Adegbeye, a Nigerian writer, speaker, and founder of Quietly Queer. OluTimehin discusses parenting in a queer relationship in Nigeria, compassion-focussed activism, and protecting your peace. Reading a letter that she wrote at 25 to herself aged 16, OluTimehin reflects on what it means to accept yourself as existing both within and beyond your body, how to find self love in oppressive environments, and what it means to sometimes (just sometimes) divest yourself from the fight.\n\n\nGrowing up with gal-dem is taking a short break as we prepare for Season 4.
