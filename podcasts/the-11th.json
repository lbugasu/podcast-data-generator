    "description": "The 11th is a podcast that publishes an entirely new issue on the 11th of every month. Inspired by the experience of opening a magazine you love every month and not knowing exactly what you will get, but trusting that something engaging and true will be there waiting for you. Many stories aren’t meant to be a 10-part series and don’t fit the format of a weekly show. The 11th is a home for those in-between ideas. Made up of reported series and personal journeys, fiction and musicals, deep investigative journalism and intimate conversations. Each issue, a different voice. Every month, something new.\nThis month on The 11th, Charles Spearin is a long-time member of the band Broken Social Scene. In 2007, he was on paternity leave, spending time with his kids on the playground, talking with his neighbors. That’s when he started noticing the musical quality of the voices around him. \nHe asked his neighbors to come over to his house so he could interview them. And then he turned their voices into songs.",

Inspired by the experience of opening a magazine you love every month and not knowing exactly what you will get, but trusting that something engaging and true will be there waiting for you. Many stories aren’t meant to be a 10-part series and don’t fit the format of a weekly show. The 11th is a home for those in-between ideas. Made up of reported series and personal journeys, fiction and musicals, deep investigative journalism and intimate conversations. Each issue, a different voice. Every month, something new.\nThis month on The 11th, Charles Spearin is a long-time member of the band Broken Social Scene. In 2007, he was on paternity leave, spending time with his kids on the playground, talking with his neighbors. That’s when he started noticing the musical quality of the voices around him. \nHe asked his neighbors to come over to his house so he could interview them. And then he turned their voices into songs."
