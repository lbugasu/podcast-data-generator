The whole Fab 5 lineup is here and ready to talk after a summer full of questions – and we need answers. As we head back to work, school, and well, reality, we're talking about a reboot. We are pressing the restart button on our lives this fall, and getting real about what exactly we're doing. But what does reality mean now? What lessons have we learned and unlearned? How are we moving forward as individuals and as a community? From summer expectations in love, life, work, and friendship to why we don't have more men crying in the rain for us, we're heading into this new season with clear boundaries, love for each other, and a little something called discernment.
