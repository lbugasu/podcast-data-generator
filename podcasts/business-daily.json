We hear how Microsoft wants to increase its slice of the gaming sector. Mobile stock trading apps have been booming in popularity during the pandemic, opening the door to millions of new, often young, or first-time investors. For many in the finance sector it is great news, but there have been questions raised about whether people always know the amount of financial risk they are taking on. Also, we focus on China’s economy, and hear what impact the ‘zero Covid’ policy and approach has made. Plus, we stop and smell the roses of the global flower industry - and follow one supply line from Kenya to Amsterdam to find out how green the sector really is. And as the original Winnie the Pooh book falls out of US copyright, we hear what potential new adventures might be in store for the “bear of very little brain”. Business Weekly is presented by Sasha Twining and produced by Matthew Davies.",

                "summary": "On this edition of Business Weekly, we’re looking at the US inflation rate. It has hit 7% year on year, the largest rise since 1982. Used car prices and food costs are shooting up. We hear from Wells Fargo Economist Sarah Watt House and Gerald Daniels, an Associate Professor of Economics at Howard University who specialises in the economics of inequality.\nThe BBC’s Ed Butler looks at the recent protests in Kazakhstan and we have a look inside the UK trials into psychedelic drugs for patients suffering with depression. Plus, we browse the shelves of ultra rare whisky, and hear why, and how, some parts of the Scottish industry are booming. The BBC’s Elizabeth Hotson talks to both keen collectors, and dedicated producers.\nBusiness Weekly is presented by Sasha Twining and produced by Clare Williamson."

We hear from Michelle Teng, a mother who co-founded a biotech firm called SynaptixBio, that is looking to find the world’s first treatment for a rare neurodegenerative disease. Also in the programme, the Chief Medical Officer at Genomics England, Dr Richard Scott, tells us his hopes for the future of genomics medicine. And Dr Segun Fatumo of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, explains why Africa is so important when it comes to genetic research.

                "summary": "In the remote mountain villages of Guizhou, China, indigenous people have been handmaking clothes for centuries. But with so many young people leaving rural areas for jobs in China's manufacturing centres, those ancient skills are disappearing. Angel Chang tells us how she quit her job in the designer fashion houses of New York to start her own clothing line, employing indigenous craftspeople to grow organic cotton, use natural dyes and sew her collection by hand. It’s part of a wider shift away from the highly-polluting fast fashion industry. We also hear from Nicole Rycroft, founder of the NGO Canopy, which is changing the way popular brands source the world's third most popular fabric: viscose, which is traditionally made from the wood-pulp of trees. Vivienne Nunis asks if this more environmental approach can be adopted by the wider fashion industry. Producer: Sarah Treanor.

We hear from British adventurer and writer Pip Stewart, who contracted Leishmaniasis on an expedition through the jungle of Guyana. She received treatment in the UK, but it was a harrowing experience. Pip explains how her Guyanese friends have to resort to excruciating home remedies to try and stem the parasite. She’s written a book about her ordeal: Life Lessons from The Amazon. We also get the view from Ethiopia, where Dr Helina Fikre explains the difficulties in treating the same parasitic illness. Dr Laurent Fraisse from the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative tells us about his organisation’s search for better treatments, while Dr Madhukar Pai calls for an overhaul of the way tropical diseases are funded.

                "summary": "At any given time, about a million American families are looking to adopt and most prefer newborns. The industry is regulated on a state-by-state basis and many advocates argue that, not only the existing rules are not enforced properly, but that much greater federal regulation is needed to ensure that the whole process is ethical and safe. \nIvana Davidovic hears from Shyanne Klupp, who says she felt pressured by an adoption agency to give her son up for adoption when she wanted to change her mind. She is now a reform campaigner and wants the private adoption industry, in its current form, abolished.\nMaureen Flatley, who has been working in the field of adoption legislation for two decades, is very concerned about the internet blurring the lines of legality and ethics and \"trading of children\" on social media without proper oversight. She hopes that 2022 will see some federal legislation governing this field finally implemented. \nAnd adoptive parents from Ohio explain why, after spending $70,000 on their first adoption through an agency, they have decided to take the matter into their own hands and advertise themselves online as prospective parents.\n\nPHOTO: Woman holding little boys hand walking down the street/Getty Images"

So how hard is life for the female half of the population, as the Taliban reassert control?\n\nTamasin Ford hears from her colleague Yalda Hakim, who recently returned to the Afghan capital Kabul, the city of her birth, where she quizzed members of the new regime about their intentions for girls' education. Tamasin also speaks to Mahbouba Seraj of the Afghan Women Skills Development Center in Kabul about what life is now like in the city. \n\nMeanwhile Marianne O’Grady, who worked in Afghanistan for the charity CARE International until she was evacuated in August, says that with food now running desperately short in the country, there are even more pressing concerns than the treatment of women.\n\n(Picture: Afghan girls look out next to a building in Sharan, Afghanistan; Credit: Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images)"

                "summary": "Is the Western diet ready for farmed insects in food? Although insects are consumed by more than two billion people worldwide, acceptance of them in the Western diet is still low, but could that be changing? With climate change, a growing population and an increased demand for protein all putting pressure on our food system, insects offer an interesting and more planet friendly alternative to meat and fish. Malena Sigurgeirsdottir is the co-founder of Hey Planet which has just launched a meat substitute using buffalo beetle powder (that's the lesser mealworm or Alphitobius Diaperinus), in Denmark, Germany and Sweden. She tells us how great insects taste, especially when they're ground up. Professor Matan Shelomi, from National Taiwan University, Department of Entomology outlines how farming insects can have a much lower carbon foot-print than farming animals. Meanwhile in the UK, Kieran Olivares Whittaker has received millions of dollars in funding for his Entocycle project, researching the optimum way to farm black soldier fly larvae to feed fish and poultry instead of using soy and fishmeal which causes deforestation and overfishing. And we meet Aly Moore of Bugible who makes a living from eating and promoting bugs as a source of protein.\nProduced and presented by Clare Williamson.\n(Image credit: HeyPlanet burger; Credit: Hey-Planet.com)"

Ed Butler hears from Peter McGirr, who runs Green energy, a UK gas and electricity firm supplying about a quarter of a million households. Higher energy prices could lead to all types of additional business challenges. Sven Holester is the Norwegian President and CEO of Yara, Europe's second largest producer of commercial fertiliser. He says the spike in energy prices has already affected his firm's production. The cost of higher gas is affecting food prices, fertiliser, even abattoirs. But is it all Russia's fault? We ask Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford.\n\nProducer: Benjie Guy\n\n(Picture: The Slavyanskaya compressor station, the starting point of the Nord Stream 2 offshore natural gas pipeline.)"

                "summary": "The economy of Afghanistan is collapsing as remittances and foreign aid dry up. As the militant Taliban consolidate their control over the country, it's unclear whether they will be capable, or even interested, in propping up the economy to prevent further humanitarian crises. Today on Business Daily, we're looking at how the economics of life under the Taliban. Professor Jonathan Goodhand of SOAS University of London, explains how the Taliban managed to generate revenues over the years since the US invasion, from local taxation on commodities, as well as support from sympathetic parties outside the country. Ian Hannan, a British mining engineer, says the Taliban has also benefitted enormously from mining in recent years. Now, the big question is whether they will be able to manage the country's entire economy, and Vanda Felbab-Brown of the Brookings Institution in Washington D.C. thinks Afghanistan cannot survive without the aid it has relied on for decades.\n\n(Image: Taliban militants in Kabul on August 16th, 2021.

                "summary": "Women in the drinks industry share their stories to try to change the way women are treated in pubs, clubs and bars. After many shared stories of harassment in craft breweries, the consensus is: enough is enough. Charlotte Cook, an experienced brewer, says the most important thing is to believe the stories, as some are being silenced by UK libel laws. Professor Chris Land from Anglia Ruskin University explains how certain workplaces can create unhealthy cultures, while bartender Nichola Bottomley says she was inspired to speak out after years of abuse working in pubs and bars. In the US, Victoria James, who was named the country's youngest sommelier at 21, has inspired other women working in wine to come together to speak out - and her book led to many responsible to resign. Becky Paskin, journalist and co-founder of Our Whisky, talks about the repercussions she faced after calling out sexism in the whisky industry. While Brad Cummings, co-founder of craft beer company Tiny Rebel tells us why it's no longer business as usual after the firm was called out by former employees online.\n\n(Images: Alcohol being poured.

                "summary": "Simulmatics Corporation pioneered data analytics in the 1960s - raising the same qualms then as fake news and social media manipulation do today.\nManuela Saragosa speaks to historian Jill Lepore, whose book \"If Then: How Simulmatics Corporation Invented the Future\" charts the company's rise, and its role in helping John F Kennedy get elected US President in 1960.\n\nAt the heart of their work was using mainframe computers - a novelty at the time - to crunch polling, census and electoral data on voters in order to figure out the best targeted messages for their candidate to voice. It foreshadows the far more sophisticated modern use of data to target voters on social media. So what lessons from history are there for us today?\n\n(This programme originally aired September 20th, 2020.)\n\n(Picture: Two men work at a console in a Univac computer room in 1960; Credit: H.

This will mark the first time such a high-ranking Vatican official will face trial over financial crimes, but Gerald Posner, an investigative journalist and author of God's Bankers: A History of Money and Power at the Vatican, explains financial scandals themselves are nothing new for the Vatican Bank. And Massimo Faggioli, Vatican historian and Professor of Theology and Religious Studies at Villanova University, explains how this trial sits among Pope Francis' larger efforts for reform.\n\n(Picture: Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu and Pope Francis.

With ever more allegations surfacing of abuse and harassment in Michelin-starred restaurants, leaders in the industry are calling for the culture to change once and for all. Eric Rivera, owner and head chef at Addo in Seattle tells the BBC’s Tamasin Ford about the abuse he’s seen and experienced first-hand, and why he thinks it’s always white male chefs who get praised for this behaviour. Asma Khan, chef and owner of Darjeeling Express in London, says chefs should be stripped of their accolades if found to be abusive. Chef and TikTok star Poppy O’Toole says she’s worried that without positive change, an industry ravaged by Covid-19 might never fully recover.

Elizabeth Hotson talks to plant-based pioneers,  Camilla Barnard, co-founder of Rude Health and Alpro's General Manager Sue Garfitt. We also hear from ex-beef and dairy farmer Jay Wilde who now produces oat milk at his farm in Derbyshire in the north of England. And Carrie Mess, a Wisconsin dairy farmer and speaker on agriculture puts forward the case for cows' milk, whilst Deborah Valenze, author of Milk: a Local and Global History tells us the story behind milk consumption.\n\nPresenter: Elizabeth Hotson\nProducer: Sarah Treanor\n\n(Photo of various kinds of plant milk.

We’ll discover what can happen when things get lost in translation and we’ll also get some tips on how to avoid major clangers and embarrassing faux pas. \n\nWe hear from Nazir Ul-Ghani, the Europe, Middle East and Africa director of the software tool Workplace from Facebook and Roger Kreuz, a professor of psychology at the University of Memphis, tells us what can go wrong when companies try to expand into new territories without doing their homework. Plus, we get insights from Lisa Thorne, founder of TogetherGlobal.com who helps personnel in international banks better understand their colleagues in different countries; she also tells us about an unfortunate misunderstanding of her own in 1980s Tokyo. Plus, Jab Borgstrom, worldwide chief creative officer of advertising giant BBH Group, explains how his language skills and dyslexia help him approach communication in a very unique way. Plus Bibek Shrestha from NIC ASIA Bank in Kathmandu, Nepal, tells us how a simple greeting can say a thousand words.\n\nPresenter: Elizabeth Hotson\nProducer: Sarah Treanor\n\n(Picture of people talking via Getty Images)."

Owned by the elusive Russian exile Pavel Durov, Telegram has been used to coordinate global protest movements - from Belarus to Iran and Hong Kong. It’s also been accused of tolerating the extremist channels behind ISIS and the Capitol Hill riots. \n\nBut in its home country, Russia, misogyny appears to be permitted on the platform.

                "summary": "Since December, more than 600 students have been abducted from schools in north-west Nigeria, highlighting a worrying development in the country's kidnap-for-ransom crisis. We'll hear from the father of a returned schoolgirl, about the agony of not knowing what's happened to them. But it's not just schoolgirls. Nigeria is subject to a full-blown kidnapping industry, as Ikemesit Effiong of SBM Intelligence explains. And as the government denies it is paying ransoms, and calls grow for the crisis to be brought under control, Bulama Bukarti of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change explains just why it's so hard to combat the kidnappers.\n\nProducer: Frey Lindsay\n\n(Picture credit: A woman whose 2 daughters were kidnapped by gunmen cries at her home in Zamfara State, northwest of Nigeria, February, 2021.

Online trolling is on the rise as people turn to social media to take out their lockdown frustrations.\n\nMarie Keyworth hears from Lisa Forte, who used to work for the UK police's Cyber Crime Unit and has faced online abuse herself. Virginia Mantouvalou says that a social media platform shouldn’t be viewed as “safe space” to express whatever views we wish. But isn't one of the points of social media to connect with like-minded people freely? Marie puts that to Will Oremus, a senior writer for tech magazine OneZero.\n\nOur posts and comments can incur the wrath of not just online mobs, but of our employers too.

                "summary": "As the global Covid-19 vaccination drive slowly gathers pace - on Business Weekly we’ll be looking at whether vaccine passports will help us return to life as we once knew it. While the travel industry is keen to use them, scientists warn that not only will they not work properly but they could pose serious ethical dilemmas. We’ll also hear from the people scooping facemasks out of the ocean - who are warning that Covid-19 has caused a pandemic of plastic waste. In the effort to save the planet from climate change, US President Joe Biden has promised to reduce the US’s carbon emissions. We’ll hear from the American coal workers who are worried for their jobs. Also, the pandemic has thrown the global wedding industry into disarray. We’ll meet the couples who got married during the pandemic in really quite extraordinary circumstances. And we’ll look at the history of hairstyles in the workplace.\n\nBusiness Weekly is presented by Lucy Burton and produced by Szu Ping Chan."

Last year Nigeria saw its biggest ever start-up acquisition - a multi million dollar deal for digital payments company Paystack. The result was a massive shift in the minds of entrepreneurs and investors in Africa’s Fintech scene. The company which processes more than half of all online payments in Nigeria, was started by two graduates in their 20s five years ago.

It’s been billed as a populist revolt against the financial behemoths of Wall Street: a global gang of small investors driving up the price of Gamestop shares, forcing losses on hedge funds. But is there more to this David versus Goliath story than at first meets the eye? Manuela Saragosa speaks to Alex Patton who trades in his spare time when he’s not at his day job in cybersecurity. She also speaks to former Wall Street professional Alexis Goldstein who now advocates for financial regulation and to Elizabeth Lopatto from the US technology website The Verge.\n(Correction: in the programme it was said that shares had risen 70% this year when in fact they rose 70% on Friday 29 January 2021)"
