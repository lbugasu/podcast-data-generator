Because of what Jesus has done on the cross our sin was accounted to him and His righteousness is accounted to us.</li><li>Imputation: Jesus’s righteousness has been imputed (or given, or granted) to us through our faith in His Lordship.</li><li>Faith: Being able to say and confess Jesus Christ is Lord.

Is there a righteous status you can receive from Him?\n\nPropitiation: Implying it to Jesus. To satisfy (soak up) all the wrath of God. In terms of what Christ has done, He has fully paid a price in such a way that all of God’s wrath has been fully absorbed by what Christ has done so that there is none left for you.\nLaw of works: Mosaic law keeping as a means to be justified.\nLaw of faith: You achieve a righteous status not by works but by trusting in Christ.\n\nGuest Bio:\nMichael Kruger is president and professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina. Dr. Kruger received his B.S. from The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, his M.Div from Westminster Theological Seminary in California and his Ph.D at the University of Edinburgh. Dr. Kruger has served in leadership capacities for the Evangelical Theological Society and has been a visiting scholar at both St. Edmund’s College and the Tyndale House at the University of Cambridge. He is the author of many books, including but not limited to: Canon Revisited, A Biblical-Theological Introduction to the New Testament, and the Heresy of Orthodoxy. In addition to his many academic accomplishments, Dr. Kruger serves as a Pastor in the Presbyterian Church in America and is married to Melissa - who is a popular author and women’s minister. \nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n\nRomans 3:21-31, Romans 1:16-17\nKnowing Faith Episode #19 - Can You Trust Your Bible with Dr. Michael Kruger\n“Canon Revisited” by Michael Kruger\nKnowing Faith Romans Episodes\n“Paul and Palestinian Judaism” E.P.

            "content:encoded": "<p>Jen Wilkin, JT English, and Kyle Worley answer questions submitted by patrons of Knowing Faith.</p><p>Questions Covered in This Episode:</p><ul><li>In the book of Proverbs, in times where wisdom is personified, is it fair to read that as if Christ himself is speaking or being described since he is the perfect embodiment of the wisdom of God? It seems the most obvious in chapters 1, 8, and 9. Are there any misinterpretations possible in seeing those passages purely as words of Christ?</li><li>Is some sort of ministry/biblical studies degree important/helpful for leaders in the local church? (Aside from the pastor.)</li><li>How does the book of Job fit in with the story of Genesis? Does it?</li><li>What is one intentional thing you have done with your young children where you really felt you saw fruit from it in later years?</li><li>Can you give some insight on Molinism and how that coincides with or goes against the Reformed position? </li><li>When I was a kid growing up in a Baptist church, it was always the pastor who baptized people. I have noticed that occasionally the pastors at other churches in our community will allow others to baptize people. I am just curious when that shift came and does the Bible have any specifics on who can baptize?</li><li>One of the things I appreciate so much about y'all is how unashamedly trinitarian you are and how unashamedly trinitarian you encourage Christians to be. It seems as if part of this is to view every act of God in the Bible as something in which the whole trinity is involved. While one person may be the primary agent, there is still involvement from the other two persons. So, my question along those lines is what was the work of the Holy Spirit at the crucifixion? Romans 8 talks about the Father giving up the son. John 10 and 1 John 3 talks about Jesus laying down his life for the glory of the Father, but there seems to be no mention of what the Spirit was doing or how He was acting in the crucifixion. How then do we see the crucifixion as an act of the entire trinity?</li><li>Y'all have alluded to the uniqueness of the preaching event on Sunday mornings, specifically as it relates to complementarianism - what exactly do you mean by that? Why do we believe that the worship service & preaching event on Sunday mornings is unique?</li><li>How do you regard the LXX (in terms of translation accuracy)? Is it essentially equivalent to English translations or should we give it extra weight?</li><li>Since you are fans of The West Wing, I am curious if you’ve seen Newsroom.</li><li>Best books (in addition to the Bible) for someone who has been a Christian for years but is new to reformed theology? </li><li>Do you have any tips for facilitating deeper and more open discussion at Bible study?</li><li>How do you evaluate the effectiveness of women’s Bible studies and determine when to make changes when the same format has been in place for 20+ years?</li><li>How do you understand the word/title “Lord/kurios” in NT vs. OT? In the NT, it seems almost always a title applied to Jesus. In the OT (LXX), “Lord/kurios'' is also used in place of “Yahweh”. Should we be making some special connection there? (I.e. connecting Jesus and Yahweh) How should we understand this trinitarianly? Also, any thoughts about “Yahweh” (God’s personal name) being replaced with “Lord/kurios” (a title) in the LXX? (Do you think they were correct that we should not say “Yahweh/YHWH” because it is too holy?)</li><li>Is it possible to idolize the Bible?</li><li>I’m curious as to what your take is on what seems to be a movement towards lessening (in some sense) some of the OT miracles of God. The primary example I can point to is within the translation of the Red Sea as a “sea of reeds.” Lately, I feel like this has been presented as yes God did part a body of water, but it wasn’t really the Red Sea as we know, and while a miracle it was something far less impressive. The second example I can think of is the fall of Jericho as simply 6-foot mud walls in a small, vulnerable military outpost.</li><li> I just finished JT’s book. I would love to hear an example of how JT could see this working in a small church of around 100.</li><li> I think the conversation on Christophany is interesting. I’m just curious about this: if what appeared to Abraham or Hagar or in the furnace or whatever was a pre-incarnate Jesus, why is it important to call this the Son and not Jesus?</li><li>What are some good ways to discuss sexual ethics with nonbelievers? A family member recently left the church because they found popular sexual ethics (LGTQ+, trans, and personal “freedom”) to be more just and fair than biblical sexual ethics. They did this without personal lifestyle motivation; they’re in a happy marriage. Quoting Bible verses doesn’t help nonbelievers because they disagree with those verses. What is a good logical way to explain God’s plan for sexuality without simply saying “because God said so”? That doesn’t lead to discussion or convince people because they think it’s arbitrary and judgmental.</li></ul><p>Helpful Definitions:</p><ul><li>Molinism: God possesses knowledge not merely of all that is, all that isn’t, but all that could be. This knowledge is called middle knowledge. All the maybes and what-ifs. Luis de Molina proposed this idea as a way of helping reconcile free will and God's sovereignty. God could see every potential world that could possibly exist and subsequently chose to actualize a world in which there was the maximum amount of human free will and the minimum amount of evil as collateral damage. He could do this because he doesn’t just know the world that is, he doesn’t just know the world that isn’t, he knows every possible world that could be and he has chosen to actualize that world. </li><li>Trinitarianism: God eternally exists as one essence in three distinct persons, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, each of whom is fully God, yet there is One God.</li><li>LXX or Septuagint: Greek translation of the Old Testament</li><li>Natural Law Tradition: A very robust way of talking about human design that does not rely on the evidences of scripture. A way of reasoning that is informed as much by the laws of logic as it is by the witness of scripture. Example: The law of noncontradiction states that something cannot be A and non-A at the very same time. </li></ul><p>Resources Mentioned in This Episode:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/knowingfaithpodcast?listId=29ORS3FVPRNLK&ref=cm_sw_em_r_inf_list_own_knowingfaithpodcast_dp_HDG6qq5bHmqi2\">Romans Resources</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/143356629X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=trainingthech-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=143356629X&linkId=e4815b668c406dcf62d31525121f086f\">“Family Discipleship”</a> by Matt Chandler and Adam Griffin </li><li>Family Discipleship Podcast: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FamDisciplePod\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/familydiscipleshippodcast/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheFamilyDiscipleshipPodcast\">Facebook</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0842313354/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=trainingthech-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0842313354&linkId=c370d9678ea4c6d8ae48a1da35a12b22\">“Chosen by God”</a> by R.C.

It seems as if part of this is to view every act of God in the Bible as something in which the whole trinity is involved. While one person may be the primary agent, there is still involvement from the other two persons. So, my question along those lines is what was the work of the Holy Spirit at the crucifixion? Romans 8 talks about the Father giving up the son. John 10 and 1 John 3 talks about Jesus laying down his life for the glory of the Father, but there seems to be no mention of what the Spirit was doing or how He was acting in the crucifixion. How then do we see the crucifixion as an act of the entire trinity?\nY'all have alluded to the uniqueness of the preaching event on Sunday mornings, specifically as it relates to complementarianism - what exactly do you mean by that? Why do we believe that the worship service & preaching event on Sunday mornings is unique?\nHow do you regard the LXX (in terms of translation accuracy)? Is it essentially equivalent to English translations or should we give it extra weight?\nSince you are fans of The West Wing, I am curious if you’ve seen Newsroom.\nBest books (in addition to the Bible) for someone who has been a Christian for years but is new to reformed theology? \nDo you have any tips for facilitating deeper and more open discussion at Bible study?\nHow do you evaluate the effectiveness of women’s Bible studies and determine when to make changes when the same format has been in place for 20+ years?\nHow do you understand the word/title “Lord/kurios” in NT vs. OT? In the NT, it seems almost always a title applied to Jesus. In the OT (LXX), “Lord/kurios'' is also used in place of “Yahweh”. Should we be making some special connection there? (I.e. connecting Jesus and Yahweh) How should we understand this trinitarianly? Also, any thoughts about “Yahweh” (God’s personal name) being replaced with “Lord/kurios” (a title) in the LXX? (Do you think they were correct that we should not say “Yahweh/YHWH” because it is too holy?)\nIs it possible to idolize the Bible?\nI’m curious as to what your take is on what seems to be a movement towards lessening (in some sense) some of the OT miracles of God. The primary example I can point to is within the translation of the Red Sea as a “sea of reeds.” Lately, I feel like this has been presented as yes God did part a body of water, but it wasn’t really the Red Sea as we know, and while a miracle it was something far less impressive. The second example I can think of is the fall of Jericho as simply 6-foot mud walls in a small, vulnerable military outpost.\n I just finished JT’s book. I would love to hear an example of how JT could see this working in a small church of around 100.\n I think the conversation on Christophany is interesting. I’m just curious about this: if what appeared to Abraham or Hagar or in the furnace or whatever was a pre-incarnate Jesus, why is it important to call this the Son and not Jesus?\nWhat are some good ways to discuss sexual ethics with nonbelievers? A family member recently left the church because they found popular sexual ethics (LGTQ+, trans, and personal “freedom”) to be more just and fair than biblical sexual ethics. They did this without personal lifestyle motivation; they’re in a happy marriage. Quoting Bible verses doesn’t help nonbelievers because they disagree with those verses. What is a good logical way to explain God’s plan for sexuality without simply saying “because God said so”? That doesn’t lead to discussion or convince people because they think it’s arbitrary and judgmental.\n\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nMolinism: God possesses knowledge not merely of all that is, all that isn’t, but all that could be. This knowledge is called middle knowledge. All the maybes and what-ifs. Luis de Molina proposed this idea as a way of helping reconcile free will and God's sovereignty. God could see every potential world that could possibly exist and subsequently chose to actualize a world in which there was the maximum amount of human free will and the minimum amount of evil as collateral damage. He could do this because he doesn’t just know the world that is, he doesn’t just know the world that isn’t, he knows every possible world that could be and he has chosen to actualize that world. \nTrinitarianism: God eternally exists as one essence in three distinct persons, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, each of whom is fully God, yet there is One God.\nLXX or Septuagint: Greek translation of the Old Testament\nNatural Law Tradition: A very robust way of talking about human design that does not rely on the evidences of scripture. A way of reasoning that is informed as much by the laws of logic as it is by the witness of scripture.

Some suggest it’s not a biblical tool.\nIs it wrong to present Bible stories to Kids in ways that leave open room for misinterpretation solely to make it more palatable? For example, not mentioning the massive loss of life during the flood...\nWhat’s happening when Jesus breathes on the disciples in John 20?\nShould worship leaders include spontaneous worship into a Sunday service? Or is that reserved for personal worship only?\nWhy, in Ps 51:4 does David say \"against you only have I sinned,\" when he clearly has sinned against both Bathsheba and Uriah? How can I make sense of this?\nWhat are common decisions and ways churches unknowingly undermine a healthy ecclesiology?\nThanks for the show notes! What are some good resources for connecting the family lines, relationships, & blessings/curses from the OT through to the NT? What can help me not miss the references original readers would have understood?\nCan we get a last exchange on Christophanies and Theophanies?\nIn light of Genesis, take your pick. Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo? On a more serious note. If you were to teach a Bible study through Mark’s Gospel, what are some overarching themes and ideas you would want to emphasize?\nBest/most accessible books on church history for the lay Christian?\nOne is the #1 book or resource you wish you would have had/used/read early in your ministry (1st year) rather than later?\nWhat are helpful responses when participants in church discipleship programs and bible studies consistently don’t do the homework?\nCan young children of believers partake in the Lord’s Supper along with their parents?\nWhat is the difference between God’s presence in Eden/Tabernacle/Temple and his omnipresence?\nWhat’s a novel or story outside of scripture that has had an impact on your life or worldview?\nWhat is the discipline of God? Is it us living with the consequences of sin or something more?\nWhat is the most frequent question each of you receive?\nFavorite chips and dip?\nIf you could only eat one dessert for the rest of your life, what would it be?\nWhat are we studying next year?\n\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nEcclesiology: Doctrine of the church.\nChristophany: An appearance of the Son of God before the incarnation.\nSpecial (Redemptive or Blessed) Presence: God directs his blessed presence to particular places at particular times throughout the Old Testament and in the New Testament is demonstrated through the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit. Manifested for the good of his people in unique times, places, and ways.\nGeneral Presence (Omnipresence): God rules and reigns over all things, everywhere fully present.

            "contentSnippet": "This episode Jen Wilkin, JT English, and Kyle Worley are joined by Dr. Rebecca McLaughlin to discuss some hard questions. \nQuestions Covered in This Episode:\n\nWhat do we do when we are asked a hard question and we don’t know the answer? \nHow does your training in literature relate to how you handle the scriptures?\nWhat is the best way to respond when someone asks a hard question?\nLots of hard questions emerge from the first eleven chapters of Genesis, but one of the most challenging for most believers is around creation. How do you talk about the doctrine of creation with seekers and skeptics?\nHow would you respond to someone who says “I can’t believe Christianity, because you know, science”?\nIf you were going to sit down and read Genesis with a non-Christian person, how would you do that?\nIf you were to start reading the scriptures with a non-Christian, where would you start?\nWhat would you say to someone who is listening to this who has doubts about the goodness or truthfulness of God’s word?\nHow should we approach these conversations?\n\nGuest Bio:\nDr. Rebecca McLaughlin holds a PhD from Cambridge University and a theology degree from Oak Hill seminary in London. She is a regular writer for The Gospel Coalition and author of Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World’s Largest Religion. You can follow her on Twitter or Instagram, or her own website.\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n\nGenesis 1-11, John 11, Matthew 5-7, John 13-17\n“Confronting Christianity” by Dr. Rebecca McLaughlin\n\nAmazon affiliate links are used where appropriate.

            "content:encoded": "<p>Jen Wilkin, JT English, and Kyle Worley explore how to think about global crises and what the Bible says about the “last days.”</p><p>Questions Covered in This Episode:</p><ul><li>It is not uncommon, in the face of global crises, for conversations to pick back up regarding the end times, the last day, the end of the world, the 2nd coming of Christ. Have you heard this or felt it during these strange days of the world reeling from the COVID pandemic?</li><li>Why does it seem like people are drawn to this question/idea?</li><li>How do you respond when someone asks you, “Are we living in the end times?”</li><li>Is Jesus's return imminent?</li><li>Should we live as though his return is imminent? What does that look like?</li><li>What are the different views on the end times?</li><li>What are the essential beliefs about the end of the world?</li><li>Q&A:</li><li>What is the significance of the daughters of Zelophehad, historian numbers, why would that provision have already been in the law?</li><li>How would I talk about the end times with high school students?</li><li>What is orthodox belief?</li></ul><p>Helpful Definitions:</p><ul><li>False Stories: All of us are living in the midst of a narrative that informs us on what the good life is. By default all of us are living in false stories and need to be invited to participate in the true story - the Christian story.</li><li>Progressivism: The story that says, “Things are continually getting better.” Advancements in science, technology, economics, etc., are constantly improving the human condition. The good life is the belief that through human ingenuity, we are better today than yesterday and we will be better tomorrow than we were today.</li><li>Pre-Millennialism: The view on the end times that we are existing prior to a millennial reign of Christ Jesus, it typically treats the millennial reign as a defined 1,000 year period that will occur. Within this view there are different views on the rapture and tribulation.</li><li>Amillennialism: The view on the end times that the millennial rule and reign of Christ is a real thing but doesn’t have a time signature. With the coming of Christ Jesus, there was a millennial rule and reign that we are currently living in that is between the already and the not yet. We are living in the millennial rule and reign of Christ Jesus that will be consummated in the second coming of Christ Jesus. Typically do not hold to a view of rapture or tribulation.</li><li>Post-Millennialism: The view on the end times that a progressive reality that Christ Jesus has inaugurated the Kingdom of God and that even now is beginning to restore, remake, and recreate the world through Christ Jesus’ rule and reign and the Spirit empowering life of God’s people, the body of Christ on earth, who are functioning as the primary ministers of reconciliation bringing all things back into union with Christ Jesus. Either believe this is going to happen after a defined period of time has elapsed, or that this will happen progressively over time and be consummated with the return of Jesus Christ.</li><li>Theological Triage: The effort to rank different doctrines differently.</li></ul><p>Resources Mentioned in This Episode:</p><ul><li>Matthew 23-26, 1 Thessalonians 4-5, Revelation 20-21, Matthew 16</li><li><a href=\"https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/creeds/apostles-creed\">The Apostles’ Creed</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310201438/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=trainingthech-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0310201438&linkId=73cf8f19f2a85d692e37c60c54eac69e\">“Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond”</a> by Darrell L.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Jen Wilkin, JT English, and Kyle Worley explore how to think about global crises and what the Bible says about the “last days.”\nQuestions Covered in This Episode:\n\nIt is not uncommon, in the face of global crises, for conversations to pick back up regarding the end times, the last day, the end of the world, the 2nd coming of Christ. Have you heard this or felt it during these strange days of the world reeling from the COVID pandemic?\nWhy does it seem like people are drawn to this question/idea?\nHow do you respond when someone asks you, “Are we living in the end times?”\nIs Jesus's return imminent?\nShould we live as though his return is imminent? What does that look like?\nWhat are the different views on the end times?\nWhat are the essential beliefs about the end of the world?\nQ&A:\nWhat is the significance of the daughters of Zelophehad, historian numbers, why would that provision have already been in the law?\nHow would I talk about the end times with high school students?\nWhat is orthodox belief?\n\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nFalse Stories: All of us are living in the midst of a narrative that informs us on what the good life is. By default all of us are living in false stories and need to be invited to participate in the true story - the Christian story.\nProgressivism: The story that says, “Things are continually getting better.” Advancements in science, technology, economics, etc., are constantly improving the human condition. The good life is the belief that through human ingenuity, we are better today than yesterday and we will be better tomorrow than we were today.\nPre-Millennialism: The view on the end times that we are existing prior to a millennial reign of Christ Jesus, it typically treats the millennial reign as a defined 1,000 year period that will occur. Within this view there are different views on the rapture and tribulation.\nAmillennialism: The view on the end times that the millennial rule and reign of Christ is a real thing but doesn’t have a time signature. With the coming of Christ Jesus, there was a millennial rule and reign that we are currently living in that is between the already and the not yet. We are living in the millennial rule and reign of Christ Jesus that will be consummated in the second coming of Christ Jesus. Typically do not hold to a view of rapture or tribulation.\nPost-Millennialism: The view on the end times that a progressive reality that Christ Jesus has inaugurated the Kingdom of God and that even now is beginning to restore, remake, and recreate the world through Christ Jesus’ rule and reign and the Spirit empowering life of God’s people, the body of Christ on earth, who are functioning as the primary ministers of reconciliation bringing all things back into union with Christ Jesus. Either believe this is going to happen after a defined period of time has elapsed, or that this will happen progressively over time and be consummated with the return of Jesus Christ.\nTheological Triage: The effort to rank different doctrines differently.\n\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n\nMatthew 23-26, 1 Thessalonians 4-5, Revelation 20-21, Matthew 16\nThe Apostles’ Creed\n“Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond” by Darrell L.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "On episode 68, Jen Wilkin, JT English, and Kyle Worley continue talking about the Apostles' Creed. They talk about what \"sin\" and \"forgiveness\" mean.\nQuestions Covered in This Episode:\n\nWhy are we looking at the creed? What is the creed? When is the creed? Why does it matter for us?\nToday turning our attention to: “the forgiveness of sins.” Is it significant that this line is here?\nWhat is sin? Is there a difference between sin and sins?\nWhat is original sin? Total depravity?\nHow has sin impacted me, us, the world?\nWhat is forgiveness?\nHow can I be forgiven? How am I forgiven?\n\nThe Apostles’ Creed:\nI believe in God, the Father Almighty,\ncreator of heaven and earth,\nI believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,\nwho was conceived by the Holy Spirit\nand born of the virgin Mary.\nHe suffered under Pontius Pilate,\nwas crucified, died, and was buried;\nHe descended to hell.\nThe third day He rose again from the dead.\nHe ascended to heaven \nand is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.\nFrom there He will come to judge the living and the dead.\nI believe in the Holy Spirit,\nthe holy catholic church,\nthe communion of saints,\nthe forgiveness of sins,\nthe resurrection of the body,\nand the life everlasting. Amen.\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nSin: “Sin is lawlessness in relation to God as lawgiver, rebellion in relation to God as rightful ruler, missing the mark in relation to God as our designer, guilt in relation to God as judge, and unclean in relation to God as the holy one. Sin is perversity touching each one of us everywhere and at every point of our lives.” J.I. Packer\nOriginal Sin: The state of all people at birth that consists of impending consequence for guilt and disordered desires that infect every aspect of human nature so that no one is able to reorient one’s self from this inward curve.\nFederal Headship: Represented by one person; either by Adam or by Christ.\nTotal Depravity: By nature, we have disordered loves: we do not love that which we ought to love. Attempting to change the telos, or end goal of humanity from the Kingdom of God to the Kingdom of Man.\n\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n\nGenesis 1, 3, Isaiah 6, Leviticus 16, Romans 9-11, 1 John 2:1, 2 Corinthians 5:21\nThe Apostles Creed\nTraining the Church\nKnowing Faith Episode #64 – What is the Church?\n“Hard To Be” by David Bazan\n\nAmazon affiliate links are used where appropriate.

How were people able to write under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit if they were not indwelt with the Spirit?</li><li>What do you think is the biggest need is for college kids?</li><li>When a church fills a pastoral vacancy with someone who is outside of where the church has been theologically or denominationally, what do you do when there are differences? Should you stay or go somewhere else?</li><li>How do we reconcile the prevalent evil that has prevailed? Do we just let it be, or do we continue to voice objections?</li><li>Kyle, what was your original tagline for Mosaic Church?</li><li>If a 12-year-old asks what is the difference between a Christian man and a Christian woman, what would you say?</li><li>Recently there have been discussions over complementarianism in the SBC. There was recently an incident with John Macarthur and Beth Moore. What are you guys going to say about this?</li><li>What are the benefits or dangers of reading the apocryphal or non-canonical writings?</li><li>General-purpose commentaries or resources for bible study and teaching?</li><li>Can we speak of Jesus Christ as eternally existent or just the Son only?</li><li>What would you say to a friend who says they don’t need any other sources for spiritual growth outside of scripture?</li><li>The difference between the Son being eternally begotten and eternally subordinate?</li><li>Is the bible only inerrant in its original manuscripts and what does this mean for trusting the bibles we have?</li></ul><p>Helpful Definitions:</p><ul><li>Solo Scriptura: Scripture alone.</li><li>Sola Scriptura: By Scripture alone. The Bible alone is authoritative but we need tradition to come alongside to help us become better readers.</li><li>Eternally Begotten: The Son’s unique attribute in relation to the Father and the Spirit: the Son is sourced in the Father, but there was never a time when the Son began.

            "content:encoded": "<p>On this mini-episode, Jen Wilkin and JT English talk about false stories—what they are, which are most prevalent, and how the true story of the Gospel provides a solution.</p><p>Questions Covered in This Episode:</p><ul><li>What are false stories?</li><li>Which of those do you most typically see people living in?</li></ul><p>Helpful Definitions:</p><ul><li>False stories: All of us are living in the midst of a narrative that informs us on what the good life is. By default, all of us are living in false stories and need to be invited to participate in the true story - the Christian story.</li><li>Romanticism: The story that says, “You are your emotions.” The more intense the emotion the more authentic it is. The good life is authenticity.</li><li>Consumerism: The story that says, “You are what you have.” Worth is based upon the value and quality of what belongs to me. The good life is having great things.</li><li>Rationalism: The story that says, “Whatever seems reasonable to you must be true, despite emotions or religious belief.” Only our own reason or experience can be trusted.

            "contentSnippet": "Jen Wilkin, JT English, and Kyle Worley answer questions from listeners. They cover topics like eternal subordination of the Son, the closed nature of the canon and more.\nQuestions Covered in This Episode:\n\nEternal Subordination of the Son and Complementarian Theology: Let’s talk.\nHow do we defend the closed nature of the canon?\nWhat is the meaning of 1 Timothy 2:15 -- “women are saved through childbearing?”\nThe doctrine of justification: reformed view v.s. NT Wright’s position?\nWhat did Jesus do in the three days between his death and resurrection?\nWhy do women no longer cover their hair in worship? (Cor. 11:2-16)\nDoes prayer change God’s mind?\nHow do you define what is theologically essential?\nPer our episode on kid theologians: Is it dangerous to say things like “Jesus loves you” to potentially unsaved kiddos?\nIf you’re a lay person, thinking about formal theological training to help you lead as a lay person, how do you approach choosing a degree? Master of Arts? Theology? MDiv? Focus in apologetics? Theology? Biblical studies? There’s so many options it’s hard to know where to start.\n\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nEternal Functional Subordination of the Son: A position that subordinates the Son’s divine will to the Father’s divine will.\nTritheism: Three different god’s with three different wills.\nComplementarianism: All humans, both male and female, have been created in God’s image. We share in dignity, power, authority, the mission of God; but men and women are not interchangeable; they are distinct.\n\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n\nGenesis 1-2, 1 Timothy 2:15, Acts 15, Galatians 2, 1 Corinthians 11:2-26\nTVC The Role of Women Short\nTVC The Role of Women Long\nKnowing Faith Episode #19 - Can You Trust Your Bible with Dr. Michael Kruger\n“Justification Reconsidered” by Stephen Westerholm\n\nAmazon affiliate links are used where appropriate.

What does it mean and how can we practice this well within the church?\nQuestions Covered in This Episode:\n\nWhat is complementarianism?\nWhy do we care about this doctrine?\nHow should theological method play a role in the complementarianism discussion?\nWhat arguments are put forward in regards to trinitarianism? \nOur views on complementarianism have to live in the tensions of scripture: What is New Testament preaching? How do we synthesize 1 Cor. 14 with 1 Tim. 2? What is the nature of authority?\nWhat offices of the church are available to men?\nWhat offices of the church are available to women?\n\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nComplementarianism: All humans, both male and female, have been created in God’s image. We share in dignity, power, authority, the mission of God; but men and women are not interchangeable; they are distinct.\nTheological method: How do you appropriately draw conclusions from the bible. \nEternal functional subordination: A position that subordinates the Son’s divine will to the Father’s divine will.\n\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n\n1 Timothy 2, Judges 5:2-31\nTVC The Role of Women Short\nTVC The Role of Women Long\nKnowing Faith Episode #10 - Brothers & Sisters: Can we Do Theology Together?\n“Classical Trinitarianism and Eternal Functional Subordination” by Steve Holmes\n\nSponsored by:\nYou can learn about the Bible through the eyes of its people.

How should we prioritize exercise and healthy food choices?</li><li>As Christians, are we able to live without sinning?</li><li>Does God speak to us through thoughts in our mind? For example, we ask God something, and the first thought that pops in our head is from Him?</li><li>Is there an age of accountability?</li><li>Lord’s Supper: Who takes it, how often, and why?</li></ul><p>Helpful Definitions:</p><ul><li>Communication of Attributes: The relationship between the two natures and the one person of Jesus Christ. Jesus has all of the attributes of his divine nature and all of the attributes of his human nature. </li><li>Nestorianism: A Nestorian would admit the full deity of Christ. They would also affirm the full humanity of the person of Christ. It looks as if this is orthodox because they admit to both the full deity and full humanity but unfortunately they would not proclaim the unity of the person.They segregated the humanity from the deity.

What brand of laundry detergent does Kyle use to get the toothpaste out of his shirt? </li><li>How can we understand God’s moral will versus His sovereign will? He commands: Thou shalt not kill.

What are the key Christian beliefs that anchor or provide ballast for the stewardship of influence and power? \nWhat does it look like for the church to forsake or lose these anchors? \nIt seems like churches that fancy themselves as theologically sophisticated can have some of the most pronounced struggles with stewarding authority faithfully. Why does it seem like an emphasis on theological clarity leads to abuse of power? \nIs there a need for recovering the role and value of institutions in an age of anti-institutional bias?\nWhat is the biblical basis for believing in the influence/good of institutions in the world?\nWhat is a practical step to be a part of an institution?\n\nHelpful Definitions:\n\nCataphatic Theology: Declaring something is true.\nApophatic Theology: Refraining from speaking because you can’t possibly give words to the reality you are trying to approach.\nInstitution: Is a cultural pattern that can last over time and can spread through space, the world. \n\nGuest Bio:\nAndy Crouch is partner for theology and culture at Praxis an organization that works as a creative engine for redemptive entrepreneurship. He is also the author of many books including: The Tech-wise Family, Strong and Weak, and Culture Making.\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n\nGenesis 1, Luke 1:34, Philippians 2:4-11, John 13:1-17\nPraxis\n\nSponsored by HOPE International:\nChrist calls us to care for those living in poverty.

Why is this significant?\nWhat does “Hosanna” mean? Is it important that Jesus is referred to as the “Son of David?”\nDoes the triumphal entry connect to enthronement and coronation?\nSo, Jesus enters the temple, and starts flipping tables. Why?

Will there be free will in the new heavens/new earth?</li><li>Why did God create Satan? Why would an all knowing God create someone he knew would be the ruler of darkness? How did Satan sin in a sinless heaven?</li><li>Where was the Holy Spirit during the Old Testament?
