Christian and Pedro collaborated to make Stitches, a CSS-in-JS library which boasts a near-zero runtime allowing for super performant styling with tooling for variants, utilities, and theming. Stitches’ performance paved the way for Modulz own component system which powers the design tool they’re building.
