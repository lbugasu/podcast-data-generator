The news we cover this week includes recent events in Sudan, Kehinde Wiley’s artist residency in Dakar, a nuclear project irradiating tsetse flies, and more.\r\n\r\nOur featured conversation is with Erin Pettigrew, an assistant professor of History and Arab Crossroads Studies at NYU Abu Dhabi. Her research focuses on 19th and 20th century West Africa and histories of Islam, race, and healing in colonial and postcolonial contexts. Their conversation touches on how people deal with change over time, including practices involving the spiritual realm, which draws on what Erin learned in working on her exciting book project, To Invoke the Invisible: Islam, Spiritual Mediation, and Social Change in the Sahara. They also talk about Erin’s next book project on the history of a leftist political movement in Mauritania. Their conversation begins at 11:01. &#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://ufahamuafrica.com/2019/06/08/ep71-a-conversation-with-erin-pettigrew-on-muslim-spiritual-mediators-locally-relevant-research-and-more/\">More <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Ep71.

We chat with George Bob-Milliar and Lauren MacLean about recent student protests at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), where George is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of History and Political Studies. Lauren was on campus during the protests visiting Ghana for research; she is the Arthur F. Bentley Chair and Professor of political science at Indiana University at Bloomington. \r\n\r\nIn addition to telling the story of how the KNUST protests unfolded and the grievances students had that led to the protests, George and Lauren talk more broadly about what the protests (and state response) mean for academic freedom, democracy in Ghana, and more.
