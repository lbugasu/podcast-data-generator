    "description": "\r\n      <p>From prisons to protests, immigration to the environment, Peabody Award-winning Reveal goes deep into the pressing issues of our times. The Atlantic says \u201cthe experience of each episode is akin to a spoonful of sugar, even when it\u2019s telling a story about Richard Spencer\u2019s cotton farms or a man\u2019s final days as a heroin addict.\u201d Reveal is a project of  The Center for Investigative Reporting and is co-produced with PRX. The show is hosted by Al Letson and partners with reporters and newsrooms around the world, including The Washington Post, ProPublica, APM, The Marshall Project and The Investigative Fund. Reveal is a Pulitzer Prize finalist and has won many broadcast journalism awards, including a duPont and three national Emmys.</p>\r\n    ",

Slaves who were happy to work for them. That twisted history is also shared with schoolchildren on class trips.

                "summary": "\r\n        Sixteen-year-old Myon Burrell was sent to prison for life after a stray bullet killed an 11-year-old girl in Minneapolis in 2002. Amy Klobuchar, who was Minneapolis\u2019 top prosecutor, brought first-degree murder charges as part of a national crackdown on gang violence \u2013 a crackdown that engulfed young men of color.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBurrell maintained his innocence for 18 years in prison. Associated Press reporter Robin McDowell spent a year looking into his case and found that multiple people had lied about Burrell\u2019s involvement in the shooting and that police didn\u2019t talk to his alibi witnesses. In December 2020, the state commuted Burrell\u2019s sentence, allowing him to walk free.\u00a0\n\nThis end to a prison sentence is rare: Burrell\u2019s case was the first time in at least 28 years that Minnesota commuted a sentence for a violent crime case. But the factors that put Burrell in prison are not rare at all. According to The Sentencing Project, over 10,000 people are serving life sentences in the U.S. for crimes committed when they were juveniles. Half of them are Black. Burrell\u2019s long shot reveals just how difficult it is to right a wrong in our criminal justice system. How many others like Burrell are there?\r\n      "

                "summary": "\r\n        President Donald Trump has granted clemency to several controversial people, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump\u2019s friend and political operative Roger Stone. But what about the people who have applied through the official process and are waiting for answers? We go beyond the headlines and tell the story of a pardons system that\u2019s completely broken down. In 2019, we focused on the case of Charles \u201cDuke\u201d Tanner, a former boxer who was sentenced to life in federal prison after being convicted of drug trafficking. His arrest came during the war on drugs, which started in the 1980s, disproportionately putting tens of thousands of Black men in prison for decades. Tanner applied for clemency twice, his application just one among 13,000 others waiting for a decision at the federal Office of the Pardon Attorney when our show first aired.

In this episode, we trace the rise and fall of Madoff through Fishman, who spent years interviewing investors, regulators and even Madoff himself from inside federal prison. We learn how Madoff pulled off his scam, and why nobody caught on for decades.

The boat is filled beyond capacity and starts to take on water and sink. A rescue ship run by nongovernmental organizations from Europe is poised to help, but a coast guard boat from Libya intervenes, creating a standoff at sea.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we learn why so many migrants \u2013 mostly from Africa \u2013 end up trapped in Libya and about the conditions they face when they\u2019re there. Krafft meets a young Nigerian man named Osaze Sunday, who was held for ransom and trafficked in Libya before attempting to escape by boat to Italy. </p>\n\n<p><em>Don\u2019t miss out on the next big story.

                "summary": "\r\n        In December 1944, Adolf Hitler surprised the Allies with a secret counterattack through the Ardennes forest, known today as the Battle of the Bulge. In the carnage that followed, there was one incident that top military commanders hoped would be concealed. It\u2019s the story of an American war crime nearly forgotten to history.\n\nAfter desperate house-to-house fighting between German and American forces, American soldiers wrested control of the Belgian town of Chenogne. Americans rounded up the remaining German prisoners of war, took them to a field and machine-gunned them. \n\nReporter Chris Harland-Dunaway found an entry in General George S. Patton\u2019s handwritten diary referring to the incident in Chenogne. Patton called it murder. So why then was there no official investigation?\n\nThrough vivid interviews with a 93-year-old veteran who witnessed the event, conversations with historians and the last surviving prosecutor from the Nuremberg Trials, and analysis of formerly confidential military records, we investigate why justice never came for the American soldiers responsible for the massacre at Chenogne.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the next big story.
