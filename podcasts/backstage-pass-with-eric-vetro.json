On Backstage Pass, Eric’s celebrity students retrace their vocal journeys, from the very first song they ever sang, through notable challenges in their careers. Listen to Ariana Grande talk about the blessing and curse of perfect pitch. Hear Chloe Bailey’s transformation from singing at a summer camp to signing with Beyoncé. Eric is part therapist, part life coach as listeners become privy to the intimate relationship between student and teacher. You’ll hear these singers as you've never heard them before, and you may even learn to sing a little better yourself.",
