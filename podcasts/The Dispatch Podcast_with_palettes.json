Plus, why it\u2019s imperative to teach students how to code. And why, contrary to Republican talking points, January 6 was not an ordinary day. Finally, how the Republican Party can be more competitive with people of color, young people, and suburban women.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nShow Notes:\r\n\r\n-Will Hurd\u2019s upcoming book \r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

Plus, how do Republicans win back the suburbs? Christie argues that suburban voters didn\u2019t abandon Republicans because of issues; they just didn\u2019t like Donald Trump.

                "summary": "The Senate is set to debate the Biden administration\u2019s COVID-19 relief package this week, and today the gang talks about the politics of getting it passed. Steve posits the administration\u2019s strategy is more focused on public opinion, rather than what Republicans want: \u201cThey say \u2018we care about bipartisanship outside the beltway, not inside the beltway.\u2019\u201d Along with the relief bill, the group discusses the ongoing situation in Afghanistan and debates whether an \u201cendless war\u201d in the country is a good idea or a bad one. Jonah and Sarah disagree on how important voting actually is. And finally, some good old-fashioned election punditry. The hosts talk about the strategy memo that came out from the GOP on how to retake the House in 2022.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nShow Notes:\r\n\r\n-The Remnant with Michael Strain\r\n\r\n-Morning Consult polling on COVID stimulus \r\n\r\n-\u201cLast Exit From Afghanistan\u201d by Dexter Firkins\r\n\r\n-SCOTUSblog write up of the Arizona voting rights case\r\n\r\n-House GOP 2022 strategy memo\r\n\r\n-Democratic Party autopsy - New York magazine\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

Will news of Durham\u2019s appointment appease Republicans? Is there a legal defect in the Durham appointment? Sarah and the guys give us the breakdown.

                "summary": "Do this week\u2019s national presidential polling averages doom Donald Trump\u2019s chance at winning the election? Joe Biden has maintained a steady national polling lead of 6 to 9 points for months now, with no signs of letting up as we approach November 3. The latest CNN, NBC, and Rasmussen polls from this week show Biden in a 16-, 14-, and 12-point lead, respectively. \u201cEven if [these polls] are outliers on the top number,\u201d Jonah says, \u201cThe unspoken story about all of this is Biden is running away with it with seniors.\u201d Trump won seniors decisively in 2016 and a Democrat hasn\u2019t won the demographic since former presidential candidate Al Gore in 2000. All things considered, our podcast hosts warn that this could be one of the biggest presidential sweeps since Bill Clinton defeated Bob Dole in 1996. Tune in for a conversation about the right\u2019s transition to online social media trolling, the president\u2019s Twitter addiction, and tonight\u2019s upcoming vice presidential debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Notes:\r\n\r\n-Post-debate Dispatch Live tonight, 30 day free trial at The Dispatch,CNN poll showing Biden in a 16-point lead, NBC poll showing Biden in a 14-point lead, Rasmussen poll showing Biden in a 12 -point lead, \u201c4 Funny Feelings about 2020\u201d by Tim Alberta in Politico,\r\n\r\n-\u201cFan Service Is Not Serving Trump Well\u201d by Jonah Goldberg in The Dispatch.\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

                "summary": "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death on Friday immediately kickstarted a battle among conservative pundits and politicians over the prudence of pushing through a Supreme Court nominee before November 3. The first problem is that mail-in voting is already under way, meaning Republicans would technically be advancing a nominee during an election. Republicans have also been hypocrites about this in the past with their opposition to Merrick Garland\u2019s hearing in 2016. Steve thinks we should push through a nominee, but David, Jonah, and Sarah are more sympathetic to arguments that Trump should nominate a justice and the Senate should wait to confirm until after the election, keeping in mind Democrats\u2019 threats to throw out the filibuster, pack the court, and add Puerto Rico and D.C. to the union if Republicans have their way with Trump\u2019s forthcoming nominee.\r\n\r\nDavid and Jonah propose a deal: If Trump wins, the Senate confirms his nominee; if Biden wins, he agrees not to pack the court. Others argue that confirming a justice during an election year is just politics, meaning whichever party is in power gets to do whatever it wants. But what about principled conservatism? \u201cMy main critique of philosophical pragmatism is we are now talking about basically saying power decides every question of principle,\u201d Jonah says on today\u2019s podcast. This puts Republicans and conservatives in a bind, he argues, \u201cparticularly because for the last give or take 5,000 years, one of the jobs of conservatives has been to make a distinction between things you can do and things you should do.\u201d Tune in for a conversation about the forthcoming attacks on Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s Catholic faith should she be Trump\u2019s nominee, the upcoming presidential debate next week, and the New York Times\u2019 eagerness to rewrite its ownhistory surrounding the 1619 Project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Notes:\r\n\r\n-\u201cAs U.S. Supreme Court nomination looms, a religious community draws fresh interest\u201d in Reuters, \u201cVote on President Trump\u2019s Nomination, Senators\u2014the Sooner the Better\u201d by Matthew J.

                "summary": "On Tuesday, Israel signed two historic peace agreements with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in a major step toward greater diplomacy in the Middle East. Though the Trump administration played a crucial role in brokering both peace deals\u2014with the signing ceremonies themselves taking place in the White House\u2014media coverage of the deals has been scarce, begrudging, and dismissive of the president\u2019s involvement in the negotiations. How much credit should the Trump administration get for facilitating the deal? And more importantly, will other countries follow suit in normalizing relations with Israel? \u201cThe UAE is like a beta test of the bigger deal with Saudi Arabia if it is to come,\u201d David explains on today\u2019s episode. \u201cThis is sort of dipping the toe in the waters.\u201d As we inch toward November 3, will this deal be a major selling point for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign? According to Sarah, probably not. \u201cOur politics goes in cycles of foreign policy having domestic policy relevance, normally when we\u2019re talking about having our people overseas,\u201d Sarah explains, \u201cThis is not one of those elections.\u201d Much to the Trump administration\u2019s chagrin, this deal is simply not getting the coverage it deserves and many Americans who are more focused on domestic issues may never even hear about it at all. After a foray into the foreign policy world, our podcast hosts discuss The Big Ten\u2019s return, the conspiratorial trajectory of American politics, many Republicans\u2019 conviction that Joe Biden is nothing but a cardboard cutout for the progressive far-left, and \u2026 Grover Cleveland!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Notes:\r\n\r\n-The Remnant episode with Ken Pollack, yesterday\u2019s Dispatch Live, and \u201cSteve Bannon Is Behind Bogus Study That China Created COVID\u201d by Adam Rawnsley in The Daily Beast.\r\n\r\n-Make sure to take advantage of The Dispatch30 Day free trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

Steve, Sarah and Jonah also chat about the upcoming debates and how possible Biden blunders could either hurt him or paint him as a sympathetic figure, depending on how the president chooses to respond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Notes:\r\n\r\n-Jeffrey Goldberg\u2019s controversial investigative journalism: Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are \u2018Losers\u2019 and \u2018Suckers\u2019\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

Why on Earth is the House minority leader welcoming a racist conspiracy mongering candidate into the GOP with open arms? Our Dispatch Podcast hosts have some thoughts. It\u2019s also worth exploring how she was able to win her primary in the first place, especially with all the negative media attention she\u2019s gotten in recent months. A source close to her opponent\u2019s campaign has a theory: \u201cThe most consistent thing we heard [about why voters were supporting Greene over Cowan] was that, \u2018Well, she\u2019s gonna go and she\u2019s gonna fight, she\u2019s gonna fight, she\u2019s gonna fight.\u2019 When you prodded a little bit deeper and asked, \u2018Well what does that fight look like?\u2019 They couldn\u2019t tell you, but they just know she\u2019s going to fight.\u201d Tune in for some insights into what the future of the Republican Party will look like with a QAnon supporter in its ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Notes:\r\n\r\n-Declan\u2019s piece on the GOP\u2019s reaction to Marjorie Greene\u2019s primary win, Audrey\u2019s piece on the growing conspiracy fringe in the Republican Party, Politico article on GOP condemning Greene in June, Trump\u2019s tweet congratulating Greene on her win, Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s motto.\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

What these polls aren\u2019t telling you is that a not-small percentage of mail-in ballots that are likely to be invalidated for technical reasons, especially given most states are wildly unprepared for the sheer number of mail-in ballots that are coming their way. Whatever happens, the election is going to be ugly. Tune in to today\u2019s podcast for some punditry on how American civil society has mishandled the pandemic, a debate over whether calling female political candidates \u201cambitious\u201d is inherently sexist, and some bickering over America\u2019s best sit-down diners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Notes:\r\n\r\n-Jonathan Swan\u2019s Axios interview with the president, Sarah\u2019s newsletter The Sweep, Jonah\u2019s column this week on mail-in voting.\r\n\r\n-25 percent of the mail-in ballots cast from Brooklyn for the primary election were disqualified.\r\n\r\n-\u201cHow the Pandemic Defeated America\u201d by Ed Yong in The Atlantic.\r\n\r\n-\u201c \u2018She had no remorse\u2019: Why Kamala Harris isn't a lock for VP\u201d in Politico.\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

Larry Hogan had some blunt criticism for the incumbent president of his own political party on the latest Dispatch Podcast, and all but ruled out supporting Donald Trump in November.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis week the president said he was going to cut funding for testing,\u201d said Hogan, in conversation with Sarah Isgur and Steve Hayes. \u201cThat was one of the dumbest things I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Hogan continued: \u201cMy biggest criticism was at the beginning the president didn\u2019t take it seriously enough, and was downplaying the severity of the crisis.\u201d\r\n\r\nHogan believes that the Trump administration has since made progress with its coronavirus strategy, and he\u2019s encouraged that Trump finally donned a mask in public and spoke publicly about the importance of wearing one.

The Trump administration has closed five bases, reduced the number of American troops to 9,ooo, and signed a peace deal with the Taliban. But as Thomas Joscelyn points out in today\u2019s podcast, the peace deal is really nothing more than a \u201cpretext for justifying withdrawal.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile the United States reckons with its military presence in the Middle East, other foreign threats are lurking behind the scenes. From the Russian bounties intelligence leak to recent cyberattacks on coronavirus vaccine-related targets on American soil, Russia is engaging in shadow wars against the United States. And as Thomas reminds us, China\u2019s deep-seated anti-Americanism is also cause for concern. On this week\u2019s foreign policy episode, Sarah, Steve, and Thomas dive into these issues and address Israel\u2019s sabotage efforts in Iran, Trump\u2019s reflexive isolationism and business-minded foreign affairs strategy, and the implications of a Biden presidency for American interests abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Notes:\r\n\r\n-This week\u2019s Vital Interests newsletter on the world\u2019s most dangerous alliance, and Thomas Joscelyn\u2019s podcast Generation Jihad.\r\n\r\n-Trump\u2019s West Point commencement speech,and the latest reporting on Israel and Iran.\r\n\r\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."
