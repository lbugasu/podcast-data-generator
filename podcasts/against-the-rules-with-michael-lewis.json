    "description": "Michael Lewis published his first book, \"Liar's Poker,\" in 1989. It’s about his time as a bond salesman on Wall Street — and it was a runaway best seller. Pushkin Industries is re-releasing it for the first time as an unabridged audiobook, read by the author. And to celebrate, Lewis has made a special mini-series about the book. We’re calling it Other People’s Money: A Liar’s Poker Companion.\niHeartMedia is the exclusive podcast partner of Pushkin Industries. ",
